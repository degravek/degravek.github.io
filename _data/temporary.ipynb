I did and on Thursday December 1st The supervisor called and said they were going to drop the truck off on Friday December 2 , 2011 .\",\"3 days later on Monday December 5 , 2011 I emailed the

is worse then ever and is really loud every time I hit a bump.\",\"Also there's a short with the left light on top of the truck.\",\"Well the Supervisor Contacted me again that day and said he wasn't going to fix anything on the truck because Capital One auto finance sent the contract back because I told Capital One that I did not want the truck and I kept trying to return the tuck and that I felt like I was getting ripped off.\",\"So he said he's not doing anything till he gets paid from the bank.\",\"So I called the bank and spoke to a few people and they all said yes you have no finanical obligation with the vehicle , your loan has been denied.\",\"I emailed the supervisor and told them what the bank said and I also told him Im not gonna help him get me a loan for a truck that hasn't been fixed.\",\"He then called and left me a very threaten voicemail telling me that he just spoke with his buisness partners and managers and that they are indeed getting paid from Capital

contacted by Dominick Avena to start working on a deal.\",\"The price they were asking was about $4K over NADA, but the STi is highly desirable and I understood the higher price.\",\"I was able to negotiate $2K off of the price, but things went south very quickly from that point.\",\"Here were the main issues I had with this dealership:\\n\\n1) When I first inquired about this vehicle, I was told I needed to hurry up and close the deal because the car wouldn't last long.\",\"Well, this is the first line from \\\"used car salesman 101\\\" and statements like have the opposite effect on me.\",\"If they want to hurry up and make a deal, there must be something going on that I need to take time to evaluate.\",\"2) The dealership's site never posted any actual pictures of the car.\",\"When I asked for pictures, I was told that it wouldn't be on the lot very long, so taking pictures would be a waste of time.\",\"(Interestingly enough, they sold the car at auction within 2 weeks on me first inquiring about car.)\",\"3) The ad said that the engine would have a lifetime warranty.\",\"When I asked about the warranty, I was told the vehicle was being sold \\\"as is\\\" and had no warranty whatsoever.\",\"4) At one point Dominick called me up and started the conversation by saying \\\"I have good news!\\\"\",\"However, during this very same phone call he told me that the car needed 4 new tires and that they were going to increase the price of the car from our negotiated price to account for this.\",\"Based on my experience, I will never purchase a car from this dealership.\",\"This is by far the worst experience I have had regarding a car dealership.\",\"Recently looked at a used Mercedes on their Used lot.\",\"The weather was lousy, so I assumed the car checked out (back to this shortly).\",\"I had them get me an appraisal on my trade, which they came back with a low ball offer, acting as if he was able to talk up his manager to get him to cover the amount owed (why would I voluntarily give you my car for $0 to flip/profit and sell if I could just pay it off myself and keep it?).\",\"So we talked price, the sales person kept focusing on monthly payment.\",\"I kept focusing on bottom line all-in sales price (because I know I wanted as small of a loan as possible for a payment stretched out as long as possible).\",\"Of course the $2000 below market price did not include $1450 in MSI (hence the focus on monthly payment).\",\"Knowing this trick, I told him several times that MSI was NOT in the ad (bought a truck there before that they snuck MSI in on us 'Yeah, the ad does say Tax, Tags, MSI...'.\",\"So, even though it legally was not a part of the ad, it became a bargaining point with the sales person.\",\"Slow-forward 2 hours later (after several 'can I get your committment requests' that I think were intended to lull me into submission) sales manager' tells me that I'm right about MSI not being in the ad and that he can't charge it, BUT he would have that corrected tomorrow, so we would have to buy the car today (fast forward to today, ad hasn't changed) Told them I would have to let my wife drive it (I live 10 mins away) before we decided.\",\"THEN I drove the thing...  Shame on me for assuming that the car was in good mechanical order and wasting time with all the nonsense above, but the car drove like crap.\",\"My older model Benz with double the miles was immeasurably smoother and quieter than it.\",\"Beyond the loud, rough ride, several safely bulbs were in need of replacing (which they said they would they would fix), so I am not sure how it passed a $1450 MSI) and the fog lamp glass was busted (they didn't understand the concept that they would have to replace the entire housing at $500+ and not just the glass).\",\"Also- the car only had one key, no mats, there was a worn patch on the driver seat and the Merz B Service was due (uhh... my manager probably won't go for doing that).\",\"Just to prove I wasn't hearing things, I test drove almost the exact same car the next day elsewhere and the difference was night and day.\",\"SO in the end, I politely returned the keys and told them that we decided to pass on the car.\",\"The 'sales manager' didn't seem too concerned, I supposed as he was losing out on the $1450 MSI juice. \",\"I bought 2 used cars on the SAME DAY!\",\"BOTH cars ended up needing service.\",\"The next week.\",\"My

See Cars\\\".\",\"Both employees looked at each other and I could tell neither of them wanted to help us but then the man said ok I'll help you today.\",\"At first I didn't think much of it.\",\"But as soon as he started helping us I caught on and realized that they really didn't want to waste their time helping two young girls look for cars because they assumed they weren't going to sell a car to us.. His name is Raza A.\",\"(sales consultant).\",\"He asked what I wanted to look at and I told him I was interested in getting a Z and right off the bat he told me I don't know if you can get that car.\",\"He still went to show me the car and as we walked over to it he started asking realistic questions about my past car history and if I've ever had a car under my name, and I replied yes and that I had good credit, so then he was like \\\"Oh maybe you can get a car then\\\".\",\"I know his job is to sell a car but the fact that he just assumed it was Unrealistic for a 21 year old to afford a Z is what upset me the most.\",\"I have a good job and make good money.\",\"Anyways, back to this visit at Nissan at San Bernardino.\",\"So after he explained the prices ect.\",\"He went on to show me other more affordable cars and he told me he would choose a Maxima over a Z any day.\",\"I know he's just trying to sell a car, but what kind of guy would choose an family car over a nice sporty car?\",\"bullshit.\",\"The whole point of my visit was to look at the Z's and ask about used Z's and if they had any.\",\"I told him that.\",\"So he took me inside to give him my contact info so they can call me if they ever get a used Z. I went in and they have two show cars there, A GTR and an old Classic Fairlady, and I was admiring how nice the Fairlady was when Raza (sales consultant) jokingly said maybe you can get this car too.\",\"And I don't know if it was just me or not that he said it in such a sarcastic tone.\",\"That just ruined my whole visit at Nissan.\",\"And I hope I never have to go through any of that again.\",\"Later on I went to car max and they were so friendly even got approved for a $32k loan for a car.\",\"I hope Nissan realizes that they just lost a possible sale due to their sexist sales

be quick.\",\"Ummmm....no.\",\"The sales manager or whatever he was was horrible.\",\"First he knew I was already approved and assured me that they would not run my credit again.\",\"HA!\",\"He ran my credit 4 more times!\",\"I know this because I received an email from Credit Karma the next day.\",\"I told him the payment I needed.\",\"He comes back with a payment of $100.00 more!\",\"I told him no, if I am unrealistic with the payment I desire just tell me and I will not waste anymore of your time or mine.\",\"He had the audacity to tell me, \\\"Well people with much better credit than you are accepting this offer.\\\"\",\"What????\",\"Are you kidding me???\",\"How rude!\",\"So then he suggests I look at a Sentra.\",\"I didn't want a Sentra.\",\"He tells me it's similar to what I want.\",\"I don't want similar!\",\"I want the car I asked for!\",\"So we go back and forth for 2 hours.\",\"Finally he says $350 a month, will you shake on it?\",\"SERIOUSLY????\",\"THAT'S WHAT I TOLD YOU 2 HOURS AGO!\",\"So we agree on the deal.\",\"When I finally get to finance, Yogi was the one who helped me.\",\"He was awesome!!!\",\"He was just very sweet and nice.\",\"I wanted the extended warranty and he made it work and kept my payment at the same I had agreed to.\",\"So if I were to be rating this experience on Kristian and Yogi's performance it would have been a 5 star rating.\",\"Unfortunately, that other guy, (whose name I don't know) brought it down.\",\"If Nissan actually reads this and can figure out who this guy is, maybe they can let him know that lying and insulting customers is not the way to go!!!!\",\"If it weren't for the fact that Kristian had been so wonderful I definitely would have walked out.\",\"Oh, and by the way I love my 2015 Nissan

the rental because all they cover is 20 days and we've had it for 52 days and the general manager Mike Guerra came out and told him unless we pays the $800 we can't have our car (that I pay $630 a month for even while they have had it since July 8th) and to leave the property!\",\"The whole place is a scam don't ever take your car there!\",\"They don't even honor the warranty that comes with

just drop it off at 8am and it will be done by 5pm that day shouldnt take longer than that !\",\"We even go to parts to make sure they have the parts in stock to change it which they do !!\",\"So come

done by lunch thursday\\\" i tell i cant due to only having one car and with work i wouldnt have a way.\",\"He says well just let me know if your gonna come get the car before we start tearing up yes he said tearing it up !!\",\"All i could think was wow what horriable and awful service paying over $20,000 for this car still under warranty i might add and cant even get a sensor replaced !\",\"And the best part was when i went to go pick up my car jorge (the service guy) said \\\"HONESTLY I DONT GET PAID TO FIX THIS WARRANTY STUFF , JUST THE TRANSMISSIONS AND THE BIG STUFF\\\" so im there left in ah like wow.\",\"So my car or my warranty arnt worth fixing?\",\"I tried to reach the service manager but as always he wasnt in either i just pray i can find some place to get this fixed

seem to care about your customers just the big stuff he fixes to call her back.\",\"You couldnt even call her back or me why would someone want to continue to speak with someone who already showed they dont care about the issue?\",\"Even on your website it says you offer rentals while our car is being serviced nowhere does it say maybe if we have one avaliable we werent upset that the car would be there for how ever long we just asked for a rental while yall had it due to the fact we only have one car at the moment!\",\"Just admit its poor customer service bud like why would even a tech or whatever say \\\"he doesnt work on warranty stuff n he doesnt know he just works on the big stuff how i posted earlier\\\"??\",\"So dont comment and try to save face saying we discussed this because we havent instead of fixing the issue you point us to the same guy who already didnt help us that doesnt make sense at all mike!!\",\"But thank you for your comment and just really dont fix your

me back so I decided to call back on Monday  (Day 6 not counting the weekend).\",\"When I called back that Monday I had to call 3 separate times because Heather who answers the phone in service (why she can't find out the status of my vehicle is beyond me) either does not know how to work a telephone or intentionally hangs up on people.\",\"Maybe she is a middle man to mitigate George's busy workload?\",\"Either way I had to call back and requested the Service Manager who got George on the phone (this George guy seems to be the only one who can communicate with the techs) who tells me I am next in line.\",\"Awesome I think so I patiently wait to call Thursday afternoon and I get the same rules around that George is busy with a customer and he will call me back.\",\"I call back an

tire rotation and car inspection, I was told by the advisor, Georgiann, that one of my tires, a Cooper tire (the other 3 tires are Firestone tires), located in the front, passenger side position prior to the tire rotation, had a gouge in the sidewall but the car was deemed still safe to drive.\",\"I thanked her and then walked outside to where my car was parked.\",\"I then inspected the tires and realized the single Cooper tire on my vehicle was in the same position, noting the gouge, and that the tires had not yet been rotated (this is the second time, at this same Honda dealership, this same issue has happened).\",\"I then walked back inside the dealership and spoke with the advisor, who called the mechanic into the office from the shop and asked him to walk out to where my car was parked and explain to me what he had done.\",\"When we arrived at the vehicle, he told me he had simply swapped the front, passenger side tire for the back passenger side tire.\",\"When I confronted him and told him the Cooper tire was in the same position, he then admitted to me that instead of rotating the tires, the had simply swapped the black, plastic tire cap from the Cooper tire for a metallic tire cap from the passenger side, back tire position firestone tire - in an attempt to make me think he had actually rotated my tires.\",\"After confronting the mechanic about the tire positions being the same as when I had arrived, he suggested I give him back my car keys and the receipt so that he could take the car back into the shop and actually rotate the tires.\",\"I refused and told him I was going to speak with the management staff instead.\",\"I then walked back inside the dealership and confronted the advisor, who was very apologetic and gave me a full refund what had happened.\",\"She then ensured my tires were rotated before I left the dealership.\",\"Following leaving the Honda dealership, I drove to the nearby hospital, where I work and then home, a total of 6 miles, at most, without any major issues.\",\"On October 11, 2014 AM (Saturday morning), while inspecting the tires at home, I noticed there is now a 3-4 inch long, linear gouge, along one of the firestone tire's tread, which is clearly exposing the tire's steel belts.\",\"My concern is two-fold: I was never informed, following the vehicular inspection, of this deep gouge on the firestone tire (now located in the front, driver side position).\",\"This gouge was not mentioned following the initial tire inspection and therefore, from my understanding, was likely not present prior to my tires actually being rotated.\",\"I am now concerned about the safety of driving my vehicle.\",\"I also don't recall any particular instance from when I left the dealership until when I arrived home that would have created such a deep and large tire gouge (I did not run over any pot holes, hit any curbs, etc.).\",\"The gouge appears almost as if a slice was made into the tire.\",\"I am very worried and upset about this as well as very disappointed that this was not brought to my attention.\",\"Therefore, I am now relaying this message in hope that this problem will be corrected immediately.\",\"I have driven an accord for the past 10 years, have almost always had my cars serviced by Honda and I have never experienced any service issues before, until now.\",\"** Update: On Oct 13th AM (Monday morning), I returned to the Honda dealership to discuss what had taken place.\",\"When I arrived, Georgiann, the advisor, and I discussed my concern about the slashed/gouged tire

\\\"understanding\\\".\",\"Bob and Georgiann then ensured a different mechanic and I went back into the shop where the mechanic replaced my possibly slashed firestone tire with a new firestone tire,

Friday, he spoke with the owner of the dealership about the situation.\",\"Unbeknownst to me, Mike was already in the process of not only investigating the situation but states he was in the process of sending myself an email to offer a ride to anywhere I needed to go, in order to ensure my own safety and to have my tire replaced, free of charge.\",\"Mike was also incredibly apologetic and told me he was deeply embarrassed as well as livid about what had taken place.\",\"Mike and Georgian were both extremely kind and reassuring while speaking to me.\",\"I received the receipt and told them I had to leave.\",\"Of all the dealerships I have gone to I have never had a worse experience then at Motorcars.\",\"The sales reps that I have dealt with are rude and demeaning.\",\"My wife and I

did not take the time to explain to me the details of the car or answer my questions.\",\"Unlike other dealers I visited, he did not even accompany me for the test drive.\",\"Being a first time car shopper, I would have appreciated more time and help with my selection.\",\"Furthermore, there was a lot of confusion on the dealer's part in the process of filling out the paperwork and I had to leave work to make several unnecessary trips before I was able to finally pick up my new car.\",\"The WORST part of my experience, however, is the service I got after I finalized my purchase.\",\"My salesperson, who used to return my calls within an hour, stopped returning my calls once my purchase was sealed.\",\"Then, to make matters worse, as soon as I brought the car home, I noticed there was a little ding on the passenger-side door.\",\"I immediately called and brought the car back to the dealer to have them look at it.\",\"My salesperson looked at the flaw and told me they could easily fix it if I brought the car in the next day.\",\"Now, I was already annoyed that my new car came with a ding, but was even more irked that I received no apology!\",\"AND, when I brought the car in the next day, he told me the mechanic was out sick and that I would have to come back again.\",\"All in all, I had to go back to the dealer FOUR TIMES before they were actually able to repair it, and the repair only happened because I got a different salesperson to help me on my fourth visit.\",\"The other salesperson was actually 100x more helpful than my original salesman, but after my car was repaired, he asked me out on a date which I thought was very unprofessional.\",\"I was hoping that my first car purchase would go as smoothly as possible, but it couldn't have been more troublesome.\",\"Maybe I just got a bad luck of the draw with my salesperson, although I do see he has some positive comments in the reviews.\",\"Perhaps he didn't treat me with the respect and time he gives his other customers because I am young and shopping for the car alone.\",\"Whatever the reason was, I was very dissatisfied with my experience with Motorcars and will not be recommending this place to my family and friends.\",\"I had called to schedule an appointment for a radiator/heat issue.\",\"The earliest I could get in was Saturday morning because of the holiday.\",\"The advisor told me that if the car started smoking, to pull over and turn off the engine immediately.\",\"Driving down a busy highway during rush hour, my truck started smoking and I pulled over and turned off the engine.\",\"I called Motorcars to get advice.\",\"They suggested I have the truck towed there.\",\"I explained that I was quite a distance from the dealership and was not in a safe position being on the side of the highway and asked if I could drive the mile to the next exit and put coolant in and let it cool for a while.\",\"The adisor told me he would have his manager call me right back after he was off the phone.\",\"I waited for about 10 minutes.\",\"After nearly getting hit twice by passing cars, I looked up other Honda dealerships nearby.\",\"I called one that was about 5 miles from where I was, explained the situation and they suggested to have it towed in and they would be expecting me.\",\"I managed to get a tow through roadside assistance, and it was towed to the dealership.\",\"I walked in and they said that they were expecting me and had a rental car waiting for me.\",\"2 hours after I called Motorcars in a panic, I finally got a call back.\",\"I was pulling in to my schools parking lot and didn't hear the phone.\",\"The manager (or whomever called) chose not to leave a message.\",\"Motorcars promotes \\\"Customers For Life\\\".\",\"After this experience, along with a few other visits with them, I will no longer consider them when I am in the market for a new vehicle.\",\"They dropped the ball.\",\"Maybe a great review as a sale organization but they do not stand up on the service.\",\"New owner, took my car there for oil change - second time noticed smoke smell from cigarettes ... ignored since I thought it was an accident.\",\"Last week I asked the service to look at my sunroof cover from inside - bad mistake.\",\"The technician stepped inside, full of grease and now my inside is all stained with ugly gray grease !\",\"The did not bother to care for the simplest basic thing - I don't even want to think how they are handling the mechanical side of things if they are so careless inside; when I showed it to the service guy start spraying cleaner on my car roof ..... horrible.\",\"No respect for someone's car ... new car that we care for gets tarnished in seconds by irresponsible workers.\",\"Will take my services to a different dealer ...\\n\",\"\\nThe day was a gray and rainy.\",\"My appointment was set for Sunday 10:30.\",\"I arrived early and Donna was first to take my service request.\",\"Dealer replaced vehicle tires with snow tires.\",\"We had an unsettling experience at Motorcars Honda.\",\"The skeleton crew they had working on sunday was obviously uneducated about the vehicles and left us sitting there waiting to talk to them about prices for close to an hour.\",\"The staff then gave us some documents with pricing information.\",\"We informed them that we were not going to finalize our purchase today and they took back the documents we had been holding on to and refused to offer them again.\",\"The other dealers we had talked to were open and honest with their pricing, but motorcars honda obviously does not value these characteristics.\",\"We're trying to make an educated decision about our car buying purchase and this dealership clearly does not want this.\",\"They use transparently deceitful and rude techniques.\",\"I will not recommend this dealership to anyone. \",\"This review relates to the purchase experience I recently had buying a 2010 Accord with 12,500 miles on it.\",\"-----\\n\\nI came in on a weekday night after work and filed out the majority of the paperwork on the car I selected and was told I would need to return to finish the remainder later in the week once they had worked out my loan with the bank.\",\"No problem - I arrived not long before they closed.\",\"Among the things we discussed were (1) the car would have 3 sets of keys, (2) that it would have its manual, and (3) due to the fact that they gave me virtually no gas in the car, that they would pay for my first fill up, just come back with the receipt when I returned and they would cut me a check.\",\"The sales manager, with whom I was filing out the paperwork, was charming and we had a good conversation.\",\"Upon my return I found out all three things would not end up being true and after expression of my distaste of how I was being treated they fixed virtually nothing (while acknowledging that they HAD told me the items above).\",\"The manager and salesperson who I worked with said that despite the fact I was told that I would be given 3 sets keys at close (2 with remote and 1 valet), that they only had 2 keys to provide and that I was free to *purchase* a key from them if it was important to me.\",\"The same held true with the manual, but they provided a coffee-stained copy of an manual that wasn't for the engine type or model I purchased.\",\"The salesman hollowly gave me the the contact information of the publisher so that I could go purchase one myself (contrary to the manager telling me at the time I began the paperwork that if they didn't have one in stock, they would order one for me).\",\"Finally, I provided the receipt for the fill up and was told that they would not pay for that either.\",\"They eventually said that I would be reimbursed for half (for which I still haven't seen any reimbursement over a month later).\",\"Obviously, these three items are not of high value but the way in which they handled once I objected was particularly troubling and lacked integrity.\",\"In fact, the manager told me to \\\"to walk away from the sale if I didn't like it.\\\"\",\"Is this who you want to buy from?\",\"Once they think they have a sale, ran your credit, etc.\",\"they will try to squeeze every last penny out of the deal.\",\"Make sure everything is in writing with these guys - their word means as much as Lance Armstrong's.\",\"It's sad keeping their end of the bargain on such small items was worth it to them to turn a satisfied customer to a customer who is willing to write a review like this and was left with a bitter taste in his mouth.\",\"Additionally, I still have to return back to get the XM set up (which was supposed to be included with buying a certified car) - they neglected to collect the necessary information from the car at the time of sale.\",\"Worst experience ever to buy a car here.\",\"The dealer here is liar.\",\"They promise you anything and regret it without second consideration.\",\"My dealer, Michael, promise me to give me a backup key on his cost but ask me to pay for it later on.\",\"We made an appointment at next day evening and he has already went home on purpose without warning me.\",\"Their dealer handle business without honest and integrity.\",\"I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN.\",\"I think what I have been through are very similar to most comments below.\",\"They took their words back.\",\"They also play game with you.\",\"They ignore your request and opinion after selling the car to you.\",\"They don't response your email.\",\"They don't answer you call.\",\"If you run into office, they tell you they are busy and come back by tomorrow evening.\",\"OF COURSE, they won't be there on next day evening.\",\"They also made a false appointment with you to let you run into office and they are off.\",\"They are tiny things but they cheat on you for that.\",\"UNBELIEVABLE. \",\"I leased Honda last year from them and took the platinum and windshield protection plan with my lease.\",\"While signing the lease no one informed me that i cant use the platinum plan outside Ohio.\",\"In fact i called the HFS and they told me if i call the dealer they will refund me the money, which i have been paying for platinum plan for last one year(Even though ia m not using it, since i am in different state).\",\"When i called the MCH, they simply said they cant do anything about it.\",\"This is not the right way you sell the car.\",\"I would recommend everyone to be very careful of this trick.\",\"I went specifically to Motorcars Honda because of all their good reviews, and I really wish I could give them 5 stars.\",\"I did end up buying a car with which I am fairly satisfied, but not without some difficulties along the way.\",\"Here are the pros and cons:\\n\\nPros\\n1) Sales associates are super friendly, nice, and go out of their way to help you.\",\"2) You don't feel pressured or pushed towards making a decision\\n3) Wide enough selection of cars that I felt like I had something to choose from.\",\"4) I feel like a got a fairly good deal on the car I bought.\",\"Cons\\n1) Within a week or so after I bought my car, the alternator gave out in the middle of traffic.\",\"Not necessarily Motorcars' fault, but not a great start.\",\"Also, they told me they had checked over everything (brakes, oil change, etc) and when I pulled the battery out to check it after the alternator incident, I discovered it was almost eight years old and corroded.\",\"Would have been nice if they'd checked that when they checked everything else.\",\"2) It took over two months and several phone calls to get the title.\",\"However, when I finally did get it they had paid for my plates and sent them to me as well.\",\"3) I bought a warranty when I bought the car and was supposed to get the information booklet and card in the mail.\",\"It's been about 5 months and I still haven't gotten it.\",\"The warranty isn't thru Motorcars so it isn't exactly their fault, it's just one more frustration.\",\"Just a few of my impressions.\",\"Based on everyone else's reviews I think this is a good business and I just happened to have a somewhat frustrating

dealership located on 2953 Mayfield Rd.\",\"in Cleveland Heights, OH 44118 for car service.\",\"After I waited for an oil change, tire rotation and car inspection, I was told by the advisor, Georgiann, that one of my tires, a Cooper tire (the other 3 tires are Firestone tires), located in the front, passenger side position prior to the tire rotation, had a gouge in the sidewall but the car was deemed still safe to drive.\",\"I thanked her and then walked outside to where my car was parked.\",\"I then inspected the tires and realized the single Cooper tire on my vehicle was in the same position, noting the gouge, and that the tires had not yet been rotated (this is the second time, at this same Honda dealership, this same issue has happened).\",\"I then walked back inside the dealership and spoke with the advisor, who called the mechanic into the office from the shop and asked him to walk out to where my car was parked and explain to me what he had done.\",\"When we arrived at the vehicle, he told me he had simply swapped the front, passenger side tire for the back passenger side tire.\",\"When I confronted him and told him the Cooper tire was in the same position, he then admitted to me that instead of rotating the tires, the had simply swapped the black, plastic tire cap from the Cooper tire for a metallic tire cap from the passenger side, back tire position firestone tire - in an attempt to make me think he had actually rotated my tires.\",\"After confronting the mechanic about the tire positions being the same as when I had arrived, he suggested I give him back my car keys and the receipt so that he could take the car back into the shop and actually rotate the tires.\",\"I refused and told him I was going to speak with the management staff instead.\",\"I then walked back inside the dealership and confronted the advisor, who was very apologetic and gave me a full refund what had happened.\",\"She then ensured my tires were rotated before I left the dealership.\",\"Following leaving the Honda dealership, I drove to the nearby hospital, where I work and then home, a total of 6 miles, at most, without any major issues.\",\"On October 11, 2014 AM, while inspecting the tires at home, I noticed there is now a 3-4 inch long, linear gouge, along one of the firestone tire\\u2019s tread, which is clearly exposing the tire\\u2019s steel belts.\",\"My concern is two-fold: I was never informed, following the vehicular inspection, of this deep gouge on the firestone tire (now located in the front, driver side position).\",\"This gouge was not mentioned following the initial tire inspection and therefore, from my understanding, was likely not present prior to my tires actually being rotated.\",\"I am now concerned about the safety of driving my vehicle.\",\"I also don't recall any particular instance from when I left the dealership until when I arrived home that would have created such a deep and large tire gouge (I did not run over any pot holes, hit any curbs, etc.).\",\"The gouge appears almost as if a slice was made into the tire.\",\"I am very worried and upset about this as well as very disappointed that this was not brought to my attention.\",\"Therefore, I am now relaying this message in hope that this problem will be corrected immediately.\",\"I have driven an accord for the past

is 1 year old (purchased elsewhere).\",\"When I went back to the place I bought it from, and they tested it, the reading was normal.\",\"Clearly a ploy by Motorcars to try to sell me on something they

a new part for my heater, which Motorcars said they would take care of for me.\",\"They told me the part would be in on Tuesday and to return anytime, no appt needed.\",\"I returned on Tuesday, only

went in when he was 15 and served 15 years, I think he likely killed somebody, but that's besides the point).\",\"He was pushy, and after EVERY vehicle we looked at that was more expensive than the last, he proceeded to tell us that \\\"this one is the best\\\" \\\"you guys need this\\\" and \\\"that last one is junk\\\" compared to the more expensive ones.\",\"We noticed that the jeep had some rust starting up under the hatch, and we addressed this.\",\"He said he'd throw in a rust treatment for it, and after signing papers for the vehicle, he informed us that they are not fixing the rust.\",\"The next day, the air conditioning went out in the vehicle.\",\"Fearful that the car was rigged enough to sell and that we'd run into more issues, we took it back and they told us to exchange it for another vehicle.\",\"While we were there, another couple traded in their Hyundai Santa Fe, and the salesman was insistent that we get this vehicle instead.\",\"It was filthy from the couple's children spilling food and drinks in the back seat, but they told us we could bring it back for detailing.\",\"So, we drove home in this vehicle.\",\"The next day, I noticed one of the speakers was blown out (something I did not think to check out while test driving), and because we had a bad experience with the last vehicle, we had purchased a bumper-to-bumper warranty, we called about getting the speaker fixed.\",\"The salesman informed us that we're SOL and that speakers are not covered under bumper-to-bumper warranties (even though it was ALREADY broken when they sold it to us).\",\"Overall, this was a miserable experience, I was stuck purchasing a vehicle from this joke of a dealership, and it was all for not because I didn't even end up keeping the vehicle that I actually wanted from them.\",\"Do yourself a favor and go to Green Hyundai, I've heard nothing but good things about the friendliness of their salesmen and their honesty, I made a huge mistake pulling my car into Landmark!\",\"They treated me like I was not important to them.\",\"I was working a deal and paperwork on a truck for a week and they  would not negotiate a deal that would benefit everyone.\",\"DONT WASTE YOUR TIME going there.\",\"High pressure salesman who was extremely rude to us.\",\"He acted 'put out' by any/all questions we had and didn't work very hard to 'earn our business'.\",\"Any price adjustment requests sent him into a 'temper tantrum' where he let us know we were inconveniencing him.\",\"I will never step foot in this dealership and don't recommend it to ANYONE.\",\"Got a car out there less than 3 weeks ago and having issues with it already can't seem to get them to take care of their end not happy.\",\"Once again screwed by a car dealership!\",\"281 dollars to replace a battery and couldn't even reset the clock for me.\",\"Only driving a Ford because it's a work vehicle and have no choice.\",\"This is the worst place to buy from I have been calling for almost a month straight now to get headrest that belong to my suv and no one will give me an answer and will not return phone calls, then when I bought my car I was told I could have any car between certain years but when I came time to do my loan they changed there mind on what years I could have.\",\"Beyond pissed!\",\"They charged me to \\\"fix\\\" an improperly remedied nationwide recall even though they say they couldn't replicate the problem or guarantee that it is fixed\",\"Well another worthless visit to #Landmark #Ford.\",\"I'm now convinced they have no clue how to fix a problem if a computer doesn't tell them what to do.\",\"After a dozen trips to the service department over the last 9 months to address a rough running #ecoshit oh I mean #ecoboost engine, they are admitting they see the issue but without a code on the computer they don't know what to do and are washing their hands of the problem.\",\"Definitely won't ever go to Landmark again to buy a vehicle, still trying to decide if I'll ever buy a Ford again.\",\"Just goes to show that a guarantee or warranty is only as good as the people or company that give it.\",\"Everyone out there steer clear of

when they fixed recalls it was too cold to clean in.\",\"Ok I will give them that.\",\"But today 5/4/16 is a nice sunny day and they did not clean my care.\",\"When they did repairs they broke a part that is behind the inside door handle and sent it home with that part missing.\",\"They were to call when it came in.\",\"It never came in.\",\"3 months later they wanted to charge for it.\",\"Everytime my car has to go here for repairs, I get upset with them.\",\"the tried to sell me a truck at msrp and when i pointed out to them the fair market value as suggested by kelly blue

a window etching.\",\"i called my insurance about the benefit.\",\"there is NONE.\",\"they insisted on charging me 200$.\",\"finally i sent them a registered letter telling them not to do it.\",\"i been in customer service most my life and have never thought to behave as they do when dealing with people.\",\"Well I did the pre approval on the internet and 3 days later a salesman called me from the dealership and took all my information including my ss# and place of employment information and my gross income monthly and even carried on a conversation with me about his niece that I supposedly work with.\",\"Now 3 weeks went my and I haven't heard anymore and I decided to call and check on things and the dealer doesn't seem to have any of my information.\",\"I explained myself to the receptionist and she hung up on me.\",\"I called back and have talked to Ryan mizenbocker a so called Mgr and he states he will call me back never calls back.\",\"All I can say is don't do business with these shady ppl they will take your personal information and than loose it and say they have no record of it.\",\"They apparently do not want to sell you a cat and by now reading all the bad

would you lie to her and tell her the only car she is approved for is a 2007 Cadillac?\",\"Obviously, I could have purchased a brand new car for much less.\",\"They only added to my financial problems

AWAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.\",\"I purchased my 2008 Nissan Rogue in December 2010 from Douglass Nissan.\",\"The Rogue had 54,000 miles on it when I purchased it.\",\"I attempted to drive the vehicle to Atlanta, GA in March 2011 but it broke down in Birmingham, Alabama.\",\"I had to get a loaner to finish the trip to Atlanta.\",\"I had repeated problems with the CVT - the car would decelerate after driving it for a while and it would not take off from a stop.\",\"I took my Rogue in to Douglass Nissan in June 2013 after nearly getting killed on the highway in Houston when it stalled in the middle of an intersection with oncoming traffic after coming to a stop.\",\"Charles - the service guy at Douglass Nissan tried to sell me CV boots but there was never any acknowledgement by Douglass Nissan that there is any problem whatsoever with the CVT.\",\"In fact, they tried to sell me another car and repairs.\",\"After numerous calls to Nissan USA and ultimately refusing to do any further business with Douglass Nissan, I took my car to Streater Smith Nissan in Conroe.\",\"After 3 years of hell dealing with the incompetent and morally corrupt Douglass Nissan sales and service department, the service tech at Streater Smith Nissan told me my transmission had failed and needed to be replaced.\",\"They also replaced my CV axle.\",\"I was given a loaner car and I now have a car I can depend on.\",\"Douglass Nissan knew that Nissan had extended the warranty from 60,000 to 120,000 on the CVT but they didn't want to do the warranty work on my car.\",\"Nissan USA was amazing.\",\"They were very helpful every step of the way.\",\"Streater Smith Nissan was amazing Randel Belt was the most conscientious and efficient person I have ever dealt with in the car industry.\",\"I will never buy another vehicle from Douglass Nissan.\",\"I will tell everyone I know to avoid Douglass Nissan.\",\"I hope Douglass Nissan sees this review.\",\"Not impressed.\",\"At all.\",\"My visit to this Dealership Service center was generally frustrating.\",\"I came in after one of my tires was damaged unexpectedly, and although one of the clerks was VERY helpful and apologetic (the only reason I feel bad about giving one star), my overall experience was subpar to say the least.\",\"Maybe it's partly because I'm a chick, but I was given frequent excuses/reasons about how long service would take by another staff member (not sure who he was).\",\"I was told that \\\"even if [I'd] made an appointment, it would probably be at least 90 minutes without a wait\\\" to replace a tire.\",\"Hmmm yeah right.\",\"Plus it's not like I am Miss Cleo and had the psychic foresight of upcoming tire damage, so the fact I was also given flack about not making a service appointment was ridiculous.\",\"Think again if you're considering Nissan.\",\"DO NOT TRUST THE SERVICE DEPT !!!\",\"My daughter took her Nissan Rogue into the service center on 2/26/16.\",\"The service advisor was David Hebb.\",\"She went in to get an oil change and have the tires rotated.\",\"The car had 13675 miles on it.\",\"She called me and said OMG, I just came in for a oil change $39.94 and a tire rotation $18.00 but they say I need over $200 worth of repairs.\",\"I told her to just have those 2 things done and we will deal with it when she comes home from school.\",\"She brought the paperwork home and it showed recommending $69 for air filters but $180.00 for a leaking left rear shock  I called them to see if that should have been covered under her 36K mile warrantly and they said maybe but he would need to look at it again to make sure it was not caused by negligent driving.\",\"When she came home for the summer, we took it with the paperwork to the Nissan Dealer in Fort Worth,  He said it was covered under the warranty,  I said why would they not have just fixed it and he said either they were lazy or just wanted to make $ off of her.\",\"She is at A&M for another 3 years but will never go back to this dealer for service.\",\"The paperwork shows work performed by Eric Pantoja.\",\"Not sure who at fault here, him or the service advisor.\",\"If this place is HOME OF THE NICE GUYS I would hate to see how bad guys act.\",\"My biggest issue is that I canNOT TRUST the repair shop at this dealership.\",\"Yesterday, my wife took her car for the state inspection, as we've been doing for many years.\",\"They told her that the tail light was out, and wanted $20 for its replacement.\",\"And that was the only issue preventing from passing the inspection.\",\"She refused, and called me.\",\"A 2-pack of those bulbs costs between $6 and $7.50 at a local store, depending on which you go to.\",\"I went to the store in the evening and bought one.\",\"Before replacing anything, I looked at the car, all lights were working.\",\"This morning, before the work, we went back to this shop, and asked to demonstrate what was wrong.\",\"Obviously they couldn't.\",\"But the service adviser (Johnny) started telling that they couldn't do anything about it because the mechanic who did it (Todd, who is the lead mechanic at this shop) is out today, and nobody else could now do it.\",\"Ultimately, after a lot of pressure and illogical resistance, he agreed \\\"to try something\\\"... And yes, they completed that inspection in the next 20-30 minutes.\",\"(I had not heard any apologies for the time wasted: we had to come for the 2nd time, I had to go to the store to buy and return the bulbs.)\",\"All that smells as a blatant attempt to upsell for something that was not needed, or otherwise - incompetence.\",\"You decide what's worse.\",\"I understand that that inspection now costs only $7, and they are not making any money on it.\",\"But this is not the way to compensate for it, by offering overpriced unnecessary replacement, and \\\"punishing\\\" if you refuse.\",\"Earlier we had a variety of problems, including much more serious ones (see the previous reviews).\",\"But the inability to trust them is the biggest one.\",\"They routinely recommend repairs and replacement that are not needed.\",\"Frequently they claim they saw indications for those problems, while they haven't even looked, just making a generic suggestion that it must be the time to do that.\",\"(They recommended replacement of the cabin air filter just about half a year after I replaced it myself.\",\"And when I confronted them with that, the response was: \\\"No, we didn't look at it, it takes as much time to replace as to look\\\".)\",\"A year ago, they refused to diagnose properly a clearly observed problem (violent vibrations while vehicle is standing still while in \\\"D\\\" gear), demanding that we must first replace the A/C (which was not broken, contrary to what they insisted on), even after it was demonstrated that the abnormal vibrations occur with the A/C switched off, just not as violent.\",\"That problem was easily fixed a year later by adjusting the target number for the idle RPMs.\",\"Earlier, they've written they inflated my tires (actually to the pressure much higher than what recommended by Nissan), but a quick check revealed that they hadn't even touched those tires: the pressure was uneven, one was significantly under-inflated.\",\"These are just a few examples of many cases when I caught them either misleading or openly lying.\",\"I hope these facts would be helpful to those who are choosing the shop for repairs.\",\"Yes, if you have certain types of Nissan-specific problems (e.g.\",\"CVT or warranty repairs - which are hard to convince that to do, as a few others said), you are \\\"locked-in\\\".\",\"And yes, they offer convenient courtesy pick-up and drop-off.\",\"For the rest, - my advise, - stay away as much as you can.\",\"I took my 2006 Pathfinder in for a battery issue.\",\"They replaced the battery but, of course, found a few other things wrong with it, one of which was a fuel level sensor, making my bill three times what it should have been.\",\"A few days later, my gas gauge was on empty when I had a half of a tank left.\",\"I took it back in and they kept it for two days.\",\"Even though they drove it 15 miles, the problem never occurred for them and their conclusion was that the fuel level sensor was new.\",\"I got the car back and a few days later, the gas gauge is on E again after I fill it up.\",\"I take it back in and they say it's because the gas tank is bowed and needs to be replaced.\",\"I bought the car 4 months ago, with a full inspection, and didn't have a problem with anything until they worked on it.\",\"All in all, I have no confidence in their work.\",\"The service department kept my car much longer than they needed to.\",\"The service desk didn't call when my car was ready.\",\"To top it all off, now I have someone from the dealership continuing to call me to persuade me to trade my car in and purchase new.\",\"I'll drive three hours to Dallas before I'll do any more business with this dealer.\\n\",\"Not a good experience with the sales team.\",\"Went in with intentions on purchasing a new vehicle.\",\"They seemed bothered that I was there, interrupting their time on the internet, and when I asked questions

longevity, and options on the vehicle.\",\"The salesman did not know his own vehicles he was selling other than what he read on the sticker.\",\"Then when I told him about the engine after I asked him to pop the hood, he thought I must be an engineer because I actually knew about vehicles...I'm sorry, I can also read the window sticker...this is 2015.\",\"I'm not bashing those who like the color of

there.\",\"Immediately I pulled in, he just came out and told me, \\\"sorry we cannot work on you car today\\\" made an appointment for 8:30am, dropped my car off for 6 HOURS, no body called or contacted me.\",\"I had to call them because I had to go to work only to hear that they didn't work on the car because the technician could not hear the noise, where as I offered earlier to show them the noise and the guy was like no, my technicians will listen for it.\",\"Couldn't go anywhere for 6 hours with the hope that my car was getting worked on while it wasn't.\",\"I'm speechless at the service.\",\"That's all I have to say.\",\"Douglass Nissan over inflated my tires by 15psi putting my family's life in danger and then tried to charge me $500 for parts that they then say my car

was sending him to work at a job site in houston for 2 weeks.\",\"When I attempted to call tod about the situation I saw that my phone had numerous voice messages and texts from tod asking me to call him back.\",\"My phone had been in my car all day so I had missed his calls (a minimum of 10 were on my phone.)\",\"When reviewing the messages he left I became quite pissed off.\",\"The first few messages just stated \\\"please call me back, your car is here\\\",  then it progressed to \\\"why arent you calling me\\\", then \\\"This is really mean of you after all the work I have done for you\\\",  then, \\\"If you really had financing, you would let me deliver the car to you.\\\"\",\"These messages were followed by pictures of the vehicle with Tod holding the keys.\",\"When I texted him and told him the situation with my spouse and that he would be back in a few weeks and I would be looking to purchase a vehicle then, he disregards everything I'm trying to tell him and texts, \\\"It sounds like your bank turned you down, you can try and finance with us.\\\"\",\"Seriously, how desperate and pushy can this salesman be.\",\"Does Tod honestly think that after he basically called me a liar about acquiring financing that I would even deal with him again?\",\"My advice for Tod; dont call your customers liars and try listening to what they are telling you.\",\"My advice for Douglass Nissan, you should retrain Tod on how to deal professionally with a customer and how to act like an adult and not a child when things don't go his way.\",\"Salesman was very courteous, polite, helpful and well informed.\",\"The finance officer on the other hand had a terrible attitude when I told him I wasn't interested in the deal they were offering, and then proceeded to continue to push a deal on me when I was ready to get my keys back.\",\"After he finally gave my keys back he said in the most condescending way good luck.\",\"I was only looking when I went to the dealership, I did find a truck that peaked my interest and spoke with the salesman and was very clear that the deal probably wasn't going to be what I was looking for, but he said to give them a chance to crunch numbers so I did.\",\"If the whole experience had went as nicely as with the salesman I'd gladly rate my experience as a 5, unfortunately the finance officer has managed to ruin any k8nd thoughts or

dealership was over on Waco Drive, the building might not have been as nice, but it sure was a lot better people working there.\",\"Number one complaint is I missed they guy (wish I could remember his

and it took about 3 minutes ( could see my truck alone sitting back there, they weren't doing anything to it).\",\"Then another time they were fixing the trucks auto tire gauge and told me than there was another recall and I would have to come in again because they were too busy that day.\",\"So I came back having to drive 35 miles (I live outside Waco) and they did the same thing, I waited around

us since nobody else had filed a complaint, that my complaint doesn't mean anything.\",\"So we tried filing with small claims.\",\"This is where it gets real interesting.\",\"Of course there are no

trip, drove the truck, liked it, ready to complete paperwork for purchase, but then the shady tactics began.\",\"Once back at the dealership, the sales person (Sam Moore) took a picture of a sign posted on the windshield which had the price of the truck.\",\"I thought it was odd that this was done, but gave the benefit of the doubt.\",\"As the paperwork began, the salesperson pulled his phone out and pulled the picture to get information, to be filled, and to my surprise, in the smallest print there was an addition of over $1200 of options.\",\"Keep in mind this is not listed anywhere with the \\u201cDrive It Now\\u201d price and was a self-generated sign printed off a computer that any child could had done.\",\"After a expressing concern (putting that part mildly), the sales manager (Larry Argo) came out and gave the story how dealers add options to all cars.\",\"Told him I was not there about other cars, just this truck, listed on the web.\",\"I informed the sales manager about the price I found listed on the net and the show began.\",\"He wanted to know just where I got such pricing, so I told him.\",\"This man should win an academy award or at least a golden globe, for his

my printout.\",\"At this point he really looked surprised that he and the salesman Sam had been caught in their web of lies.\",\"This was such dishonesty at the beginning (of a guaranteed purchase) that we felt we should leave and find a honest dealership to conduct business.\",\"Knew a 5 hour trip would be involved in purchase, so we had money in hand, ready to buy, and then Lithia Dodge tried to employ unethical tactics.\",\"I wonder just how many unsuspected people have been taken advantage by this company.\",\"Went to the service department twice.\",\"First time fixed my recall and left

asked him to check his web site and i was invited from kelly (sales Manger) after i offered the price i planned to pay but unfortunately we could not reach a deal after some discount so i decide to postponed my decision tell i check some other cars .two days later i sent Kelly tell him i will come to get the car he forget about the last price that i got from Sam then i told him no way i am not going through this ....Then he sent me couple of mails that he agree on the last price i got from Sam .I went on foot since i do not live so far Kelly call and pick me in the middle of the way and i appreciate that but it was the only thing i appreciated that day.He takes me directly to sign the papers and give the full amount payment by cheque to Jiff(finanlater on Sam took me to get the care and leave one i am inside the car on front of the driving car there was two wind shield cracks i told Sam about them he replied it is preowned car i replied these cracks was not in the car when i drove it for a test and at that time i walked around the car to check it and i found two dots of paints to cover tiny scratch and i accepted it and i will never miss something clear like this specially the are directly in front of my eys and being an Engineer and a business man at the same it became a habit for me to notice any thing .Sam said he will call the wind shield man to fill an fix it i said fine.when the man came he said this cracks are big and can not be repaired and the wind sheild must be replaced.Then Sam went inside the administration building and come after few minute (of course speaking with somebody) and said no we can not do any thing and you already signed the documents !!!!\",\"( in my mind it means i did a mistake to trust Kelly and signed the documents

them and tell me it is okey they will replace it i said okey .Sam invited me to his desk and leave me for a while then come back and said we can not do the internet market manger should agree (Kelly)

minimum of $3k for my trade in (which KBB says is worth at LEAST $3k trade in value.)\",\"Two minutes later the salesman comes back and says they can only offer me $1k for my trade because its worth about $500-700.\",\"Hilarious.\",\"The Volt I wanted was listed for $17k, but then I'm told that it's actually $20k and the $17k is just the online price, so since they've already (so generously) discounted it for me, that's why I can only get $1k for my trade-in.\",\"Okay... so now onto the payment numbers.\",\"For a $17k car, the payments per month (with no money down) were in the upper $300's to $400 a month range for 60-72 months at 5% interest.\",\"I had already told them I wanted a payment less than $300.\",\"If I wanted a car payment that was almost $400/month or more, I could

called multiple times and couldn't find my place Lol.\",\"He finally picked me up at 12:00pm 45minutes later when I live 4 minutes from the place.\",\"I get dropped off and now their is a huge line at the cashier.\",\"I had a coupon from yelp for 9.99 gm oil change.\",\"Oh ya that nobody seemed to know about.\",\"That took from 12:06pm till 12:30pm just to get rang up.\",\"The people are careless of anyones time.\",\"And have no personality!\",\"When I finally get in my car all the windows were down, its 100 out so you can bet my car was the same.\",\"And there was trash like half drunken water bottles in my car.\",\"Thanks for a stressful day I was late to all my clients house because of a oil change.\",\"And they took off my sticker on my window relating to my new tires not an oil change.\",\"Thanks for nothing!\",\"Please don't go here.\",\"I foresee you being disappointed.\",\"I understand purchasing a car is never a great process and can be very frustrating.\",\"This is the 6th car I have purchased and I have never had such a terrible experience.\",\"The purchasing of the car was not too bad but it was the aftermath that earned them a 1 star rating.\",\"A few days after purchasing my car my tire started losing a little tire pressure.\",\"I filled it up and then a few days later it went completely flat as I was driving.\",\"I go to change the tire to put the spare on but find out the the jack that was provided with the car was completely bent and unusable.\",\"I had to get a ride to a store to get a fix a flat that lasted until I got home.\",\"After putting the fix a flat in, I notice that the hole in the tire was over what looked like a patch or a defect.\",\"I called and made an appointment to have them take a look.\",\"At the appointment, the sales person initially told me there was nothing they could do about the tire, but they could replace the jack.\",\"I said \\\"Are you kidding me???\\\"\",\"I have had this car for less than 15 days and it is obvious that you sold me a bad tire, but still she would not do anything.\",\"I cannot believe that the tires and jack passed their used car inspection.\",\"I have 2 young kids and they sold me a dangerous car to drive and then said they could do nothing about it.\",\"We then proceeded to speak to a manger.\",\"His name was Mike Conway and he is amazing.\",\"He helped in every way that he could and made us feel better about the situation.\",\"As we were talking to Mike, the sales person ran up and told him to not worry about it and that she is taking care of it.\",\"All of the sudden, now that she saw us talking to a manager, she wanted to help again.\",\"She ended up replacing the tire and quickly rushing the car back to us.\",\"We explained that we didnt want a quick job done and that we want the car fully inspected before we will drive it again.\",\"We got a rental car and left.\",\"The car was finished 2 days later with a new tire and the car was detialed thanks to Mike.\",\"Mike explained that they did sell us a defective tire.\",\"I still cant believe this was not caught during the inspection.\",\"We inspected the car ourselves and find that the jack they gave us, does not fit the car and now its just rolling around in the back seat.\",\"The other 3 tires have very little tread and the new one has full tread.\",\"The car now pulls and does not drive as nice.\",\"We are goin to have to purchase 3 new tires less than a month after buying the car.\",\"To top it off, when we picked up our car there was a giant 10 inch tear on the back seat where the seat is sewed together that was not there when we dropped it off.\",\"My wife and I were so furious when we picked up the car, but decided instead of dealing with anyone else at this place again, we would rather pay for the seat repair ourselves and just be done with Courtesy Chevrolet.\",\"I would advise anyone with kids to never purchase a used car at Courtesy Chevrolet because they obvioulsy do not do very good on their inspections to make sure the vehicle is safe.\",\"I felt that every person we talked to was either trying to blame us for the tire or just simply rush us out of there.\",\"They already made their money off of me and they wanted me gone.\",\"That is how I felt.\",\"The sales person told me that the reaon the jack was bent was because of the way I jacked up the car.\",\"I told her in the nicest way possible that I never used the jack and that it was too bent to even attempt to lift a car.\",\"I was sold a car with a defective tire and a useless jack and the only person to aknowledge that was Mike Conway.\",\"I hope he can one day find a job somewhere else where he is not surrounded by rude and incompetent people because he was the only good experience we had their.\",\"I will not even return to Courtesy Chevrolet for my free oil changes because I do not want anyone there touching my car again.\",\"Would give negative score if I could.\",\"Brought my truck to have the dash replaced only to have them break my air conditioning and blame it on a coincidence.\",\"Unbelievable this place.\",\"DO NOT GO HERE EVER ABSOLUTE LIARS.\",\"Hands down among the worst customer service I have ever experienced IN MY LIFE.\",\"Bunch of con-artists here that when they do something wrong, the only thing that matters to them is: \\\"Did Courtesy Chevrolet make money on it?\\\".\",\"If the answer is yes, then you're screwed.\",\"Worse yet, if you have a problem with it and ask them to remedy it, they will not only tell you in person that they won't do anything for you, but they will also call you at your home and remind you that they aren't going to do anything about it, and if you hang up THE DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMER SERVICE will email you to let you know that they aren't going to do anything about it.\",\"It was a mistake going to a GM vehicle.\",\"I've driven Fords for years, but I made an uninformed decision to buy a Chevy because of the Volt and Cruze having great gas mileage and my GM card was supposed to give me a discount.\",\"Never doing business again with Courtesy Chevrolet and I'm done with GM all together.\",\"Impressive honestly how quickly they managed to lose my business.\",\"this place is a complete joke!\",\"i went to testdrive a 2007 blue nissan xterra last month & they wouldnt let me test drive cuz the bank wouldnt release it yet.\",\"so they strong armed me in2 signing for a loan on the car witch i wasnt comfortable doing.\",\"the loan was contingent on me test driving the car.\",\"it was in the shop all day on a friday for inspection for safety & neslxt day detail.\",\"upon test driving sunday morning it was delivered with check engine light on.\",\"wut a bunch bullshit!\",\"it also featured back up camera w/monitor after sound system witch sold me on car.\",\"the back up camera was flooded & monitor & stereo never worked, & dealer refused to fix it.\",\"i wanted this car for trqveling w/my 3yr old grandson so he could watch movies.\",\"they let me down.\",\"the car wasnt detailed.\",\"they did rake the car back thank goodness.\",\"do not ever buy a car w/out test driving it 1st & seeing the car fax.\",\"Having spent 10+ hours of dealing with their b.s.\",\"here over the past 2 days I don't have the energy to count all the ways in which they tried to dick me over due to the sheer volume of instances and the extent to which they went to try and make it happen is revolting.\",\"Long story short though, they absolutely could not care less about what you want and what is best for you.\",\"I can't emphasize this enough: They only care about how much money they can milk out of you and nothing more and will utilize every angle and tactic they can in order to make that happen.\",\"Run, don't walk, away from this place.\",\"It's that kind of dealership with an extra helping of sweet talk.\",\"I was very fortunate the deal fell through at the last second due to their incompetence, otherwise I was looking at paying $11k when you factor in the interest they said wouldn't exist because it was \\\"special financing\\\" and only magically appeared at the last second, and also taking on the extra $1.5k for their own special little extended warranty (which according to them made it so they could sell the car for so cheap) at the last second, which isn't a part of the car price they let think is the bottom line (I mean, technically it isn't part of what they officially designate car price, but also technically it's an extra $1.5k they found another way to take from you).\",\"Keep in mind I originally only went in there to get a $3k at most car to get me through the year, then let them talk me up to $5-$6k, then all the other stuff got added at the last second after taking the night to sleep on what I was originally (incorrectly) told, which was no small feat since they really, really, REALLY wanted me to sign right away and \\\"not think about it\\\" direct quote.\",\"Don't go to this place.\",\"Avoid it at all costs.\",\"Bunch of liars!!!!!!!!!!\",\"They will tell you whatever you want to hear until it's time to do the deal.\",\"I was promised $4000.00 for my trade but bc I went and got my financing myself and came back with the check they decided they didn't want my trade at all.\",\"Now I have to go back to the bank and give back the check bc of them and their not so courtesies behavior.\",\"They get money for getting you financing instead of you doing it yourself so, in the end if they don't get to make money back on you for doing that giving you a decent offer for a vehicle doesn't exist.\",\"Don't waste your time dealing with this place!\",\"Seems that contacting the main receptionist at Courtesy is now a thing of the past.\",\"Probably because they are so so busy.\",\"I'm updating my review because Courtesy did end up making a concerted effort to locate and fix my problem.\",\"There were definitely bumps along the way.\",\"My initial service writer made it a habit to NOT listen to me, but the Service Manager DID.\",\"John Dunlap, thank you for making things happen.\",\"All in all, I had to make 5 visits to Courtesy before my problem was solved, but by the end, Mike Conway, the CSI Director had gotten involved and helped make sure that they found and fixed the problem.\",\"They did finally take care of me.\",\"I'd have been able to leave a better review had it not been so difficult and inconvenient most of the way through the process.\",\"My son almost ended up with emergency dental work at one point, plus I missed a lot of work dealing with this at a very busy time.\",\"That being said, I'll still give Courtesy another chance with my next service needs.\",\"I'd like to think that they will take care of me and earn my business as they should with any customer.\",\"Seriously stop calling me.\",\"I went into this dealer to try to make a deal, we couldn't come together on a price for a new Cruze so I left, that was in April and without fail I have gotten at least one call a week from this dealership ever since.\",\"I have told then I bought a car elsewhere and to please remove me from their prospect list, that didn't work the calls just keep on coming, I think they live by the old car dealer mantra keep calling them until they buy or die (yes I was a car salesman man years ago.)\",\"They live up to the stereotypical car sales business.\",\"Shady - dishonest.\",\"Went to see a car they had posted on their website last night.\",\"Today- the car doesn't exist.\",\"Nobody knows anything about the car THEY advertised.\",\"Interestingly enough though, they had one just like it - same mileage - same year - even the same color.\",\"But priced $1,700 more than the online posting.\",\"And, while they have the stock # listed ...\",\"They don't have the car -- they say it has not arrived yet.\\\"\",\"On another note - asked if we  wanted cold water to which we both said YES.\",\"( hot day - we were thirsty).\",\"Five or six minutes later we are told there is no more cold water - they have water bottles that are room temp - we said no problem - room temp is fine.\",\"Never got water - guess is has \\\" not arrived yet.\",\"Awful experience!\",\"They are a joke!\",\"They get you into the car and do absolutely nothing for you afterwards.\",\"I was involved in a total loss accident and my Gap insurance referred me to them for a refund they sent since they were the ones I purchased the car from.\",\"I've been trying to get in contact with Nicole.\",\"WHAT A JOKE.\",\"I've left several messages and yet never got a call back.\",\"I've called numerous times before her shift end at 4:30 and NEVER got an answer.\",\"It's like you're calling a call center all the agents do is bounce you around so the next person can deal with it.\",\"It's sad because I'll never want to do business with them again.\",\"If there is nothing due on my refund that's a message im willing to accept I'm just tired of even trying to get someone to tell me even that!\",\"So frustrated!!\",\"I'm glad I got the survey from them.\",\"I let them know exactly how they are doing!!!\",\"!\",\"Update....\\nAt first I thought they wanted to address my concerns,  turns out more games.\",\"It appears Scott was contacting me to get to bottom of issue.\",\"Turns out it's actually Bryan Long commenting as Scott.\",\"Bryan said he made the orginal deal work that I was told by basically playing with the numbers.\",\"I said \\\"ok, get it ready.\",\"When should I come down?\\\"\",\"Well there has been no more contact with them.\",\"Change of owners, change of customer service.\",\"Maybe they should talk to Jennifer Vega at Chapman Chevrolet.\",\"Much better at customer service and she actually wants to sell cars.\",\"I have purchased a total of 6 vehicles from Courtesy over the years.\",\"I had the worst experience the latest vehicle I purchased (since new ownership).\",\"I had to chase them to give them money so I could purchase a vehicle.\",\"I finally purchased the vehicle from them, only because I have always had good experiences with them.\",\"This week I tried to purchase another vehicle and the same crappy service started coming up.\",\"The could not give me a realistic offer to purchase a vehicle from them even after haggling for pricing and agreeing to a price.\",\"The final offer was more than what we discussed at the sales office, by about 100 a month.\",\"I have sent many friends and family there because I had respect for them.\",\"Guess they are falling in line the well know dealership corporation here in town.\",\"Looks like Chapman Chevy will get my business.\",\"if I could I would NOT give them one star.\",\"I brought a vehicle from Courtesy Chevrolet and from the beginning they were nothing but a problem, not only did I get the rudest sales man to try and help us,  after some negotiating for a vehicle that I wanted he literally stood up and said \\\"I can't handle you\\\"  and walked away, so of course I almost lost it told the manager what happen and I'm pretty sure he did nothing about it.\",\"after I bought the car I had to take it back because I was having brake and router and electronically problems,  I got the car back after HOURS of waiting and they said the fixed the problem.\",\"the electric problem was just a fuse that needed to be pushed back in,  that simple and they didn't even do that.\",\"So while I was at work (I'm a courier)  I was with my boss and driving down hill and the breaks did not work, I almost hit a on coming car and ran off the side of the hill I was on.\",\"I brought it back again and told them to fix it and again they did they same thing.\",\"they didn't even look at the car, I actually ran off a cliff and lucky did not die.\",\"so I took it back for the 3rd time, again waited and before they were done I was told that before they sold the car they put 1,100 dollars into the vehicle, so I asked if I can get a copy of what they done.\",\"but of course the mechanics were already off.\",\"and they said they would email it to me but of course I didn't get an email or a call nothing.\",\"so I had to take it to a different place and had 1,349 dollars worth of work to my vehicle.\",\"our in a nut shell I brought this vehicle took it back 3 time almost died 2 times and was lied to and got the run around.\",\"so I would hope if anyone reads this and want to check out this dealership please go somewhere else.\",\"hopefully you won't waste your money or your time.\",\"I should hope the owner crack down on people attitude and how they would sell a vehicle that had no work done to it.\",\"the people that work there don't care once the deal is made.\",\"I could have died and they still did not even try to fix my vehicle.\",\"so just don't come here.\",\"they are worthless.\",\"I would not put one star if 0 was an option.\",\"I was a new car manager for 3 years at an auto group so i went here to get my wife's and my business partners new cars.\",\"It was just awful they changed the price many times on my business partners car and ended up sticking him with almost 4000 more than the price was suppose to be after changing the contract on him over 4 times and making him jump through hoops.\",\"On my wife's car they also played the change the price game a bunch of times but once we got the deal done they call us back in to re sign the loan paperwork because the payoff balance was a different amount, so after working all day i load up my wife and kids in the car at 6:30 pm at night and drive the 45 mins down there to wait 45 mins, then get brought into the FNI office where the lady tells us that we are not resigning but we need to pay $1,500 to cover the gap.\",\"I was upset by this because i just drove down there i don't have a check book on me or anything so I ask the question \\\"Why didn't anyone tell me that over the phone so i knew the real reason I had to come down\\\" everyone blamed everyone and no one owned up to it, so i took off and said I would be back to drop off the check.\",\"I call up there to talk to David in FNI and let him know that I was going to come down today and drop the check off for the $1500 and he said wait no you need to bring a check in for a bit over $3000!\",\"I asked how in the world is it now over 3000 when just the other day i was told to bring in 1500.\",\"He told me that I said I was going to put 1500 down, I said no I never said that and when I got the text from the sales person to come in to get the car everyone at the dealership knew I was putting 0 down and trading in a car plus its in the text saying 0 down.\",\"Also I went through FNI and did all the paperwork for the loan and nobody asked for any money down nor did they say anything about it because I didn't say I was doing doing that.\",\"So i get home today and look over my paperwork and no where in any of my paperwork does it say anything about money down.\",\"At this point i am done I have my wife empty the car and I drive down there and the lady in FNI is trying to show me on a computer screen how there was 1500 down in the deal but couldn't show me in the signed paperwork where it was.\",\"That is just crazy that these people think they can do that to people and get away with it.\",\"I gave them their car back and took my car, I have a meeting tomorrow with my lawyer and the GM rep that over sees this area, we will be buying the same car at another dealership next week but these people are going to answer for what they did they even tried to grab the paperwork I have so i wouldn't have a copy of it.\",\"This is the worst dealership I have ever been in my life and if you are working a deal with them and you are reading this RUN don't walk but RUN away they will steal your money and change your contract before you go back for paperwork.\",\"If you have done a deal with them sit down and read through your paperwork I bet the numbers don't match.\",\"They are crooks and its time for them to answer for it.\",\"OMG run.\",\"The worst ever.\",\"Tried for two days to buy car from them.\",\"Had the money agreed on price but no..Whoever manages this place needs training....Every hurdle I jumped...\",\"I would recommend going anywhere else as these people cant close the deal with the money in their face.\",\"Paperwork must be in a foreign language because everytime they went to get it they did not come back forever.\",\"Translation poor office procedures..yes.\",\"run.\",\"Run run\",\"They were great when I bought my car but the service department is lacking.\",\"They never wash the car when we have it serviced even after we ask.\",\"One time it was because the car wash was broke.\",\"They gave us a rental on one occasion that we had to put gas in and was never compensated for it.\",\"Brought it in twice for one recall because the first time they didn't have the part even after we had scheduled the appointment.\",\"You would have thought they would make sure they have parts before scheduling appointments.\",\"I was contacted a week we had the rack done to see how my service was.\",\"I explained to Debra about the car not being washed.\",\"She offered to have it detailed for us.\",\"I told her that would be fine but we needed to have the window repaired because it would not roll up.\",\"She promised the service advisor would get with us first thing the next morning(it was Labor Day when she called) needless to say he never did.\",\"After leaving two messages and waiting all day I finally contacted her again.\",\"She did have another service advisor call right back but I was without a car all day.\",\"I don't want to park it with the window that won't go up.\",\"We will see if when I get the car back sometime tomorrow if it actually got detailed.\",\"I am betting it won't\",\"Just a quick update.\",\"I e mailed this guy that said to e mail him.\",\"That was a few weeks ago now.\",\"I still havent heard from him.\",\"So again.\",\"Their customer service stinks.\",\"I was extremely disappointed with the service that I received during my visit to the dealership on 9/10.\",\"Late on 9/9, I tried to go somewhere in my car and was unable to because the battery died.\",\"It was so late that I couldn't do anything at the time, so I waited until early on 9/10 to address the issue.\",\"Even though I bought the car in mid to late June, I recognize that car maintenance is the car owners' responsibility, so my boyfriend was planning on changing the battery himself.\",\"However, when we went to change the battery on early 9/10, not only was the battery dead, but it had corroded so badly that the battery cable completely separated.\",\"I was very upset that the battery was so badly corroded because I feel that this issue should have been identified when I brought my car in for an oil change only a few weeks earlier.\",\"At this point, I decided that Courtesy should fix the problem; due to the fact that I had only had my car for two months and that I had just recently brought the car in for an oil change.\",\"So, I called my insurance company and had my car towed to Courtesy just as it opened on 9/10.\",\"George was the technician that helped me.\",\"When I talked to George, I informed him that the car was not starting because the battery and battery cable were corroded.\",\"He told me to go inside to the caf\\u00e9 waiting area while he made an assessment.\",\"I waited for an hour before I saw George again.\",\"When he returned, he told me exactly what I told him upon walking in the door: that my battery and battery cable were corroded.\",\"He then handed me a bill for $600 to fix my battery and battery cable!\",\"This is a job that my boyfriend could have done for less than $200.\",\"I was completely enraged because I am a student at ASU, using all of the money I have to pay my car bill, rent, and tuition.\",\"I bought the car because I needed reliable transportation so that I could get to my classes at the Polytechnic campus in Mesa.\",\"As a first time car buyer and soon to be college-graduate with many years of car buying ahead of me, I expected to be treated with much more respect than I was given at Courtesy during this visit.\",\"After another hour and a half of waiting and arguing with 2-3 different representatives and managers about the cost, my car was finally being worked on.\",\"Typically on Thursdays, I work in the morning and then leave for my classes at noon.\",\"By the time my car was finished (four hours after I arrived), I missed an entire morning of work ($70 of missed pay due to this car issue & waiting) and was going to be late to class.\",\"I paid the $236 dollars that I was able to negotiate down to, and left for class.\",\"You would think that my problems with the vehicle would stop there, but they didn't.\",\"As I was getting close to the Polytechnic campus in Mesa, my car started flashing that the engine was overheated and then the car started to shut off the air conditioning and, eventually, the car itself started shutting down.\",\"I pulled over and called George who suggested that the car come back to the dealership so that he and the technician could look it over.\",\"He gave me the number for a tow truck, which I had to call to come get my car.\",\"Subsequently, I missed one of my classes while waiting for the SECOND tow truck so that I could give my keys to the driver.\",\"I was infuriated that I had to find a ride home from class and that I couldn't pick my car up until later that night.\",\"I never really got an explanation as to what happened, but I was just happy that my car was finally

my car back until 2:30pm.\",\"I had my two kids with me and if I knew that it would take this long I would have made other arrangements.\",\"My car needed an alignment (I still contend at 14,000 miles

around 11:30 I found out that no work had been started on my car whatsoever.\",\"It wasn't until I questioned the advisor on the progress of the work that I found out he hadn't sent the car to the

they are assholes too they at least deliver on their promises.\",\"There's never good news about this place.\",\"About 2 months after buying my car I had to have the brakes replaced because they were so old and worn out.\",\"Now my car is in the shop having the compressor replaced because that went out.\",\"This is all on a vehicle that is supposedly a certified pre-owned vehicle, which means they

you.\",\"Some, but not all.\",\"My first maintenance visit was to update a radio recall issue on my new car.\",\"I set an appointment, but nothing was in their system when I arrived.\",\"I was told it would be a 10 minute fix, I wound up waiting for 2 or 3 hours.\",\"I'm here again for an oil change.\",\"Set my appointment from a reminder email they sent me.\",\"Yet again, everyone looks surprised when I show up.\",\"I'm not on their schedule for today either.\",\"Like I said, it's probably a computer system error or an employee training issue.\",\"This is my first car purchase from a

from Capital One.\",\"The guy who called me supposedly was with another customer and they put with me with somebody else.\",\"He didn't bother even showing me the vehicle I was looking to buy.\",\"He took me and my wife to his cubicle and went straight to credit app.\",\"I was told that they work with Capital One.\",\"Well, they disregarded my pre-approved financing.\",\"They financed me for a lower amount and told me I had to come back the next day to see if I got approved and to top it off that I could not buy the vehicle I wanted to buy.\",\"I immediately said no, thanked the salesman, gave him a hand shake and left.\",\"The look on his face was priceless.\",\"I will never go there and I don't recommend anyone to go shop for a car there either.\",\"I went to another dealership that same afternoon.\",\"They accepted my financing, and let me and my wife test drive the vehicle we were looking at.\",\"We drove off in a new car that night that was the same year, model and brand that we had seen online at Courtesy Chevy,  If Courtesy Chevy would have done what the second dealership had done, there would have been a sale and my review would have been different.\",\"I purchased my 2014 Chevrolet car used from a Honda dealer, they suggested that when I started having a couple odd noises that I take it to a Chevrolet dealer who would be better trained to figure it out.\",\"I have an extended warranty on top of the 100,000 mile manufacturer drivetrain warranty.\",\"So, I took it to Courtesy Chevrolet.\",\"I was delayed a couple days to have the appointment, I was directed to George Chacko as my service advisor, saying that is who I made the appointment with.\",\"Since he has a heavy accent I would remember and he wasn't.\",\"That is not a big deal, but it was the first flag in a long morning.\",\"He was giving the the run around about getting started, keeping me waiting, etc.\",\"They had to look at my extended warranty and then I think they just didn't want to help me, but then jumped in my car and started to drive it away when I hadn't even agreed to have the work done there!\",\"I felt extremely disrespected there!\",\"So, I went out grabbed my car and LEFT!!!\",\"Never to return!!\",\"I once went and priced cars there, they use come on tactics, like you are guaranteed to win a prize but they get you in there and try to keep you there, wear you down

from the ad and spoke to the Internet sales specialist by the name of Sola.\",\"I asked him to verify that this particular vehicle with the item number that was listed on line was available.\",\"He said he would verify and call me back.\",\"15 minutes later he called me back to tell me the suburban was still available along with a couple of other 2015 suburbans.\",\"My wife and I drove the 45 minutes from Gilbert to Phoenix to look at this particular suburban.\",\"When we get on site we are quickly met by one of the sales reps who took us to the receptionist who then called Sola to let him know we were there to see the 2015 suburban.\",\"He wasn't available but sent another rep out to meet with us.\",\"It only took about five minutes before we realize that they had tried a bait and switch with us as the second rep that came out told us that the vehicle had been sold days earlier.\",\"We walked the lot which was very small and saw no other suburbans.\",\"They then tried to show us a Colorado?\",\"Wtf it's not even the same class of vehicle.\",\"Do yourself and favor and don't let this dealer waste your time.\",\"Clearly they post fake ads online and lie about their inventory.\",\"It's too bad you can't mark them negative on car gurus well.\",\"They advertised the lowest price for the car I was looking for.\",\"When I got there they added $2500 in dealer add ons to the price of the car.\",\"They tried to charge me a $500 doc fee, a $500 prep fee, a $500 lifetime tint fee what ever that means and another $1000 for an alarm that didn't exist.\",\"Be careful buying from here!\",\"Avoid the service area like the plague.\",\"2 hours for an oil change, attitude galore from the cashier.\",\"They called my husband at work instead of walking out to inform me the truck was done.\",\"Absurd.\",\"I will NEVER refer anyone here.\",\"We went to courtesy today to look at a used Toyota Highlander that was on their website.\",\"I called ahead to ensure that the vehicle was still available.\",\"I spoke with salesperson Miguel on the phone and he assured me that the vehicle was there.\",\"He said \\\"I just had my hands on it, it's definitely still here\\\".\",\"I informed him we were travelling from Surprise and didn't want to waste a trip.\",\"He again said no worries, it's here.\",\"Right away we traveled to this dealership to view the vehicle.\",\"As soon as we arrived the salesperson said \\\"oh yes I think that vehicle is still here, but someone just test drove it so it's in the back lot.\\\"\",\"They had another lady sale associate go check and when she came back she said that the vehicle sold.\",\"We were baffled and explained the situation.\",\"We asked for a manager and she said she was one.\",\"We said \\\"well, when did it sale?\\\"\",\"She said \\\"I'm not sure, it won't show me that.\\\"\",\"When we expressed our anger, she apologized for Miguel's mistake.\",\"She asked if we were interested in any other vehicles.\",\"In conversation she then said, \\\"I'm sorry he should have seen that it sold 3 days ago\\\" ???\",\"Wait a minute..you just said it wouldn't show you when it sold.\",\"They are all liars.\",\"All they care about is trying to get you down there in hopes that you will look at something else.\",\"This place is awful.\",\"Please do yourself a favor and stay far away from it!!\",\"!\",\"Previously my reviews were bad but I had a better experience this last time and I think they actually fixed my car this time.\",\"I bought a 2015 Chevy Sonic and it's had a lot of problems so far.\",\"Hopefully it's smooth sailing from here.\",\"I am happy with the way it is running now thanks to the service department at Courtesy Chevrolet.\",\"Bait & Swtich tactics.\",\"Slimy salesmen that pressure you with predatory sales tricks.\",\"They offer a $4000 clunker program but will only honor it if you agree to their erroneously inflated sticker price that is well over $4000 above a fair market value figure.\",\"I thought slimy sales tricks and pressure were a thing of the past since I have bought many cars over the past 15 years, but nope this dealership is keeping those gross methods alive & well here.\",\"Don't waste your time with these crooks.\",\"Visited Courtesy on August 22nd 2016.\",\"Was working with a nice guy, Michael Mizell.\",\"Great customer service skills, putting the customer needs first.\",\"We were about to begin discussing numbers about a new car that I was trying to purchase.\",\"He brought over the sales manager, Dennis Renko.\",\"First off, this gentleman is by far the most unpleasant individual I have ever worked with.\",\"He is condescending and rude.\",\"Dennis was extremely rude to Mike (in front of me), telling Mike he did not have anything put together for him to review.\",\"We were chatting numbers about a car that I wanted to purchase and the potential trade in that I was going to do, and when I told him that another dealership was going to give me $4500 for my car, he laughed and said, \\\"Who would give you that for your car, your car is not worth that.\\\"\",\"He proceeded to tell me he was not going to compete with the other dealership and if I liked them so much why was I at Chevrolet?\",\"I countered, asking if he could do better, he told me no.\",\"I then brought up to him that after doing research, the fair market value of the car was \\\"x\\\" amount of dollars, based off of Kelly Blue Book, his response to me was, \\\"I don't care what Kelly Blue Book says, they aren't selling you a car!\\\".\",\"I then asked to see what the price was for Tax, Title, and Fees, and he said that he needed to run credit in order to tell me that.\",\"I advised that I had spoken with other dealerships who were able to provide me the info without a credit pull.\",\"Not sure if this a standard business practice.\",\"Dennis went back to the sales office to see about getting me more for my trade, and in the meantime, I went to chat with Mike, and apologized but advised him that I will not be doing business with him as a result of Dennis' behavior.\",\"I told Mike that Dennis is not the kind of guy I want to be doing business with.\",\"Shook his hand and left.\",\"As I was walking outside, Dennis comes running outside, screaming at me, yelling profanity, in the parking lot of the dealership, in front of customers.\",\"Completely uncalled for.\",\"For a Manager, he lacks several fundamental skills any manager should possess.\",\"In their letter from their Owner, they pride themselves in the following: Professional Service, Trust, and Integrity.\",\"None of these things, does Dennis Renko possess.\",\"Dennis was rude, unprofessional, confrontational, and down right nasty to me in the parking lot.\",\"It is a real shame to not do business with this company, as they were my top prospect.\",\"I will not recommend this dealership to anyone in the future.\",\"I have reached out for a follow up call and have filed a Better Business Bureau Complaint.\",\"Hoping to get some resolution to this!\",\"Do yourself a favor and stay the hell away from this dealership.\",\"Tried to purchase

cash back and the 4000 minimum for your trade it was either or\\n\\nI used an app on my phone that provides me another phone number and called in and spoke to two different sales people who both said

later still had no updates, but I figured it wouldn't be much longer.\",\"Two hours later I approached the cashiers desk and asked for an update and was rudely told the only person who would know the status would be my service advisor.\",\"Waited another 40 minutes or so and even attempted to call in for an update but the phone never got answered by my supposed service advisor.\",\"Three hours in I was infuriated and went to track down my service advisor who was on the phone and stayed on the phone for some time before asking what I needed.\",\"I asked for an update and was told me car was done.\",\"For how long?\",\"Who knows.\",\"I never received an update on what was done to my car nor if the oil change ever even got completed fully or if any other service was needed.\",\"I was just told to go pay and leave.\",\"I'm disgusted in the lack of customer service that was displayed through the entire experience and will tell everyone I know how terrible a time I had and to never, ever,

battery and cables.\",\"I had just got my car serviced for the 1st time since February on 8/29 passing the multi point inspection under my extended warranty (including the battery and cables).\",\"They stated my battery was leaking acid very badly and it caused corrosion on my negative cable.\",\"They tried charging my $500 stating its not covered under my extended warranty when they should have caught this on 8/29.\",\"I am highly upset I had to pay $130 for diagnostics for something they should have caught 2 days prior.\",\"Don't recommend this place to anyone.\",\"I have never encountered a more rude service technician than George at Courtesy Chevrolet.\",\"I brought in my grandmother's Trailblazer for an alignment a few months back.\",\"This car is not driven much,

into \\\"Courtesy\\\" and George said it has nothing to do with the alignment and that was normal.\",\"No, it is not normal for tires to be wearing abnormally after less than 2,000 miles.\",\"George then said that alignments have no warranty, and that no one guarantees alignments.\",\"I told him that my previous car got an alignment and Brake Masters and they provide a 12 month 12,000 mile warranty on alignments.\",\"He basically told me I was a liar and that that isn't true.\",\"It is true, because they made my steering wheel crooked and I took it into a different Brake Masters, showed them my receipt where it said the warranty and they re-did it and it was perfect afterwards.\",\"Then George showed me a line that goes through the tires in the center, saying I must be running over things.\",\"No, that is a magnetic strip that some tire manufacturers use to eliminate static electricity buildup.\",\"Then he tells me that I should get an alignment every 12 months or 12,000 miles anyways.\",\"No.\",\"that is a sales tactics.\",\"Alignment does NOT change.\",\"If it does, it is due to a worn or bent out suspension part.\",\"If that's the case then the car needs a repair.\",\"An alignment isn't going to fix that.\",\"I told him I had my mechanic check the suspension before and after this alignment and everything is tight.\",\"He told me my mechanic probably replaced a suspension part without me knowing, or did something to the car causing the alignment to be off.\",\"What?\",\"First of all my mechanic is ASE certified and worked at a Cadillac dealership for years until it went out of business (Kachina Cadillac).\",\"Second of all, my mechanic is also a friend of mine.\",\"I know what I get done to this car.\",\"George likes to pretend he's a mechanic.\",\"Next they checked the alignment with their rolling machine in the driveway.\",\"Someone else checked it and carried in the alignment sheet that showed the alignment was in the green.\",\"They carried it into his office which I was standing outside of and he didn't know I was standing out there.\",\"He then starts yelling \\\"OOOO!!!\",\"OOOO!!!\",\"OOOO!!!\\\"\",\"because he thinks he was right and was bragging to his coworkers.\",\"Absolutely rude, I was disgusted.\",\"The car wore the tires fine before the alignment and now they're wearing the inner edges.\",\"I'd rather not replace a $950 set of tires prematurely.\",\"Thanks Courtesy Chevrolet for convincing me to never be a customer again.\",\"I had a similar experience in the sales department in August when I was trying to buy a

for any period of time \\\"Of course\\\" they said.\",\"It's now September 1st and once again the problem persists except this time they advised my Father it was the Throttle Body which was replaced by another Dealership very recently as well.\",\"To their credit Courtesy dinked around with the Truck pretty much all of September as my Father brought it back 3 times to Courtesy that month after Courtesy was able to affirm the Throttle Body was new with the other Dealership.\",\"They stated it may be the FP Relay on September 19th and on September 22nd they took a stab at saying it was a

anyone can work for Courtesy as a technician given the lack of accountability or integrity behind their work.\",\"Still my Father the optimist took it into going for the 3rd month and now October 14th which somehow the truck developed a hose leak and needed coolant at the tune of $565.08?\",\"I asked my Father what that had to do with the original problem and why were there no noticeable leaks before all of this?\",\"Still he kept his faith in this Dealership and finally to the very recent month of November when they wanted to charge him over 3,000 dollars for new wiring on top of the $2,228   they already charged him with all of their time guessing!!\",\"The truck still has the original problem and actually at times they made it worse to the point of it not starting at all!\",\"The President of Courtesy Chevrolet MR.

work was guaranteed by your so called Highly Trained Professionals the right thing to do?\",\"Is wanting to charge him much more that the vehicle is worth for your guesses part of Trust and Integrity

thing.\",\"Here is what he would ask for: Fix the Truck as you promised you would or simply refund his money given the result is pretty much money spent and nothing being fixed.\",\"Sometimes there is

floor being covered in oil, THAT was a slip up).\",\"The manufacturer failed on the recall 'solution'.\",\"The Service Department failed by performing unnecessary tasks resulting in unnecessary delays, and unnecessary damage to my car (the filter housing, and frankly, my key fob).\",\"I'm not sure I can stomach bringing my car into Courtesy again, I value my car and my time too much.\",\"If

but AJ kept trying to sell him different vehicles and refused to give my friend a price point.\",\"We did not want a credit pull from the dealership and AJ claimed there was nothing he could do and that other dealerships were selling us false hope on cheaper vehicles.\",\"AJ lacked enthusiasm while dealing with us and even when he got his manager, his manager could have cared less for our business.\",\"Basically, letting us walk out of the dealership and failed to provide quality service.\",\"They were also trying to sell us cars with scrapes and dings and even dents and claimed we didn't know what we were talking about.\",\"Thank goodness we went to Chapman Chevy and had a good experience.\",\"Recently called their service department inquiring about re-flashing my ecm because I had installed a cool air intake on it and it through a trouble code (lean fuel).\",\"While trying to find out all the out the door costs the man told me that he was not a mechanic and hung up.\",\"Sense GM offers performance parts and their shops install them shouldn't their service department be able to provide info as to costs and man hours?\",\"Jack Walker was apart of the problem.\",\"I attempted to deal first with the service advisor greg.\",\"He couldn't help me and jack got involved.\",\"I had my paper from my previous appointment in the car which stated it was covered.\",\"When I spoke with jack, I allowed him to review the paperwork for verification.\",\"Then when I got to the dealership, he refused to help me and said I would have to pay the $800+ dollars..

My friend and I had made arrangements to go car shopping today.\",\"This was our third stop.\",\"We live in the east valley but chose to visit courtesy because of the gas card promo.\",\"I mean why not.\",\"Courtesy must want forks in the store.\",\"We made the salesman Treks aware of what we were doing up front and also advised as to why we drove to the Phoenix dealership.\",\"We test drove a Silverado and an Impala.\",\"Requested brochures sand went back inside with the salesman (I use the term loosely) Tres.\",\"He drops a brochure on the table and leaves.\",\"No thank you, good buy or thanks for stopping in here are your gas cards.\",\"We sat in disbelief for 20 minutes thinking he was coming back but he did not.\",\"We finally had to ask someone to get him.\",\"When he arrived we had to ask for the gas cards.\",\"He then sends over the sales manager who tells us we need to split the 60 dollar gift card between us.\",\"What a promotion!\",\"What a farce.\",\"It was bad enough that we had to ask for something that was advertised but then for that!\",\"Wow.\",\"I guess I know which dealership won't be on my shopping list when I do buy.\",\"Thanks to Treks and the  noCourtesy Chevrolet team.\",\"Visited today with a friend as we test drove several cars today around the valley.\",\"It started well by being greeted outside promptly upon arrival and assigned a salesperson named Trey.\",\"Trey was friendly but really didn't listen to us.\",\"He wasn't as knowledgeable about the product as well as other salespeople today.\",\"Basic things like horsepower,  torque, etc were not known.\",\"At other dealers the sales person knew when asked.\",\"His training was lacking and I don't blame him after meeting a manager.\",\"Anyways,  after we each test drove a vehicle we were interested in Trey got a brochure for the Silverado but was out of the Impala.\",\"He said he would be right back.\",\"He never said goodbye or had a manager talk to us.\",\"We waited and waited and waited and still no Trey.\",\"I finally asked someone after 20 minutes where he was and after 10 more minutes he showed up.\",\"He said he had an appointment scheduled and was with those folks.\",\"Maybe getting someone to help was a good idea.\",\"He had a potential $95000 in sales with us.\",\"He asked us when we were looking to purchase (we told him that initially) and if there was anything else he could do for us.\",\"We asked him about the promotional gift cards.\",\"Left and brought back a manager.\",\"He was younger and had some strange skin colored plugs in his gauged ears.\",\"I wish I knew his name.\",\"Had $60 worth of QT cards for us to share because we were together and it was 1 per group.\",\"I told him we are separate and were each interested in our own purchase.\",\"We each drove a separate car.\",\"He didn't care.\",\"Cadillac had no problem with us.\",\"Neither did Lexus.\",\"I have to tell you that I don't need to drive to Phoenix to drive a Chevrolet.\",\"I have 5 dealers much closer.\",\"I figured since a colleague (we have 200 employees) told me about the promotion I may make the effort to go to Courtesy.\",\"I will be alerting everyone about my experience and 200 families will think twice before going to Courtesy.\",\"The only \\\"courtesy\\\" we found was on the sign.\",\"I don't blame Trey.\",\"I am sure he did what he was told in his training.\",\"Management is poor and they obviously don't want to celebrate customer appreciation month by honoring their promotion or by treating customers with courtesy.\",\"It was apparent we were not valued as potential customers and they did not want to give us the gift cards.\",\"This review is not an indictment on Trey but on the dealership itself.\",\"I guess my household income of $165000 won't be returning to Courtesy Chevrolet.\",\"I don't need the gift cards.\",\"It is the principle of the matter.\",\"Came to get one of my 5 free oil changes after purchasing my car here.\",\"Waited over two hours for my oil change to be done.\",\"Even called and had a reservation days in advanced and we were still told that during the oil change they didn't have the filter for my car and it was being retrieved and should be here soon.\",\"Shouldn't they have those things ready If they know the type of car you have and when you will be coming in?\",\"It's absolutely ridiculous\",\"Bill at Courtesy was GREAT.\",\"Very helpful and courteous unlike the rest of his staff.\",\"My experience will\\nBill was good, but overall my experience with the dealership was absolutely horrible and I will not be going back.\",\"During the purchase I was told things would be taken care of which they weren't, then I was given a hard time to get things fixed.\",\"The dealership sold me a car with bad tires, so I had to go get them replaced.\",\"In the process the worker scratched up my two front rims and they wanted ME to pay to get them fixed.\",\"This dealership is horrible. \",\"Very dissapointed..... sales tream was very friendly and helpfull while I was there trying to buy my truck.\",\"That all stopped once I walked out the door.\",\"Had some questions on when my old vehicles loan was going to get paid off.\",\"Called anthony up and left 3 messages for him.\",\"Finally a week after leaving my first message he called me back.\",\"Said he would find out for me and call me back with the info, that was 2 weeks ago and still no call.\",\"If I had to do it all over again I would not buy from this dealership, would rather pay a little more for better service.\",\"Should have known though.\",\"Made an appointment to look at the vehicle the day I purchased it and I had to wait 30 mins for someone to help me\",\"Wow, just... wow.\",\"So two things have happened since we purchased that have been pretty frustrating and have really changed how I view the dealership.\",\"(I had previously given it a good review.)\",\"1.\",\"We had a tire go very nearly flat on the front passenger side.\",\"Which we found weird since allegedly the tires were brand new when we got the car.\",\"The salesman made a point of it twice during the time we were looking at the car.\",\"So when we went for our first oil change a couple of weeks later (the salesman insisted we should get it done quickly just to be sure we were starting out fresh) my husband asked them to look at the tire and see what was wrong.\",\"Not fill it.\",\"Look at it.\",\"So they came out and told him they had filled the tire and, surprise surprise, he assumed that meant they had checked it out.\",\"But less than two weeks later, the tire was getting noticeably flat again.\",\"This time, he called and explained and they said they could fill it up but that was all.\",\"He took it over and they said they'd charge us to take an actual look at the tire.\",\"Which means they didn't do it the time before.\",\"Just filled it and let us go on our merry way.\",\"We went to another place out of frustration and, shock of shocks, there was a screw in the tire.\",\"These things happen, I guess, though we drive maybe half the amount most people do.\",\"But the fact that this team let us drive out on a tire with a puncture in it... after my husband had asked them to take a look at it and all they did was fill it back up?!\",\"Not happy.\",\"2.\",\"James is the one who gave us this website and he explained that he would get $10 if we gave him five stars.\",\"He didn't pressure us to do it.\",\"So a day or two after we bought the car, I went online and filled out the form.\",\"I thought it was just a good review giving him cash -- I had forgotten it was 5 stars for the money.\",\"When my husband saw him again while waiting for the oil change, James asked how the car was doing and made some small talk.\",\"He then told my husband that he had \\\"missed out\\\" on the $10 for the promotion because it hadn't been a perfect review.\",\"Let me be clear that my husband had not mentioned the review at all.\",\"So James actually just brought it up.\",\"I consider that incredibly inappropriate.\",\"To his credit, James did say he appreciated the great review we gave him.\",\"Still, that is just REALLY not something I think should have been discussed, let alone brought up, by the salesman.\",\"Really tacky!\",\"We're now kind of disillusioned about this whole transaction.\",\"It's a good thing we really like the car, because the rest of the buying experience has rather soured in our eyes.\",\"We went looking at a used van, Greg helped us out and found one to be in decent shape with around 40,000 miles.\",\"We needed low miles because of my financing, my credit is not that great so I have to be flexible, which is fine at this point.\",\"The vehicle is running good, we want it.\",\"We work out the deal, drive home, 3 days later we get called back, because we have to resign something.\",\"When we get there we are greeted by a different woman in financing.\",\"She is not friendly, has no answers as to why we have to resign the contract which is a higher interest and payment.\",\"50 dollars is 50 dollars.\",\"Already upset at her blank stare and lack of courtesy I leave.\",\"Lets see what I have, a used vehicle, 3000 mile warranty only, but they say, it's a new vehicle so I shouldn't need anything done to it.\",\"The van is nice but, for what I paid, I could have gotten a better deal elsewhere.\",\"Now 3 months later guess what, my brakes need to be replaced, Why?\",\"Didn't they check them on this used vehicle during their so called inspection prior to selling?\",\"Why am I having to replace the brakes after 3 months?\",\"But hey it's ok I have free oil changes and free nitrogen for life, THat is nothing but sugar coated crap.\",\"I recommend you shop around, good before settling for anything.\",\"You can get a just as good vehicle or better, with a hell of a better warranty and price from one of the so called other guys.\",\"The only guy I think treated us right was Greg my salesman, but over all I am unhappy and will never shop there again.\",\"It's ok, they don't need my business, I am sure lots of people are happy with their vehicles.\",\"Maybe I will too after I fork out the money to get my brakes replaced, because Courtesy sure as hell ain't gonna do it for free.\",\"They got their money from me, they are happy.\",\"Blue Van owner  :(\",\"Criminals that \\\"try\\\" to rip you off.\",\"That is the best way to put it.\",\"After a week of empty promises and the shady dealings they still try and pull a fast one.\",\"I went in to Un-Courtesy Chevy looking at a used car i found online.\",\"It was what i was looking for but had rear bumper damage.\",\"They of-course tried to sell it as is but after talking with Eric and Herb we came to the agreement that i would buy the car if they replaced the bumper.\",\"I went ahead with the paper work but wouldn't pick the car up till bumper was replaced.\",\"One week later and showing up at the dealership 2 different times to take delivery it still wasn't done.\",\"Of course i got the lies and run around.\",\"\\\"Bumper is still being delivered\\\", bumper is here but drying so they couldn't put it on\\\".\",\"Finally they called to say the bumper was on and everything looked great.\",\"More lies, showed up to take delivery and they had tried to REPAIR the bumper.\",\"Seriously?\",\"Classic Used Car try to rip you off move.\",\"After i confronted them and refused to take the car they lie and said \\\"we never said we would replace the bumper and you have to take it as is\\\".\",\"So do you think they replaced the bumper reinforcement?\",\"It is illegal to sell a car without it do to safety concerns but they want me to drive away in it with my 3 year old daughter in the back seat.\",\"What would happen if i get rear-ended without that reinforcement?\",\"Not only did Eric and Herb try to rip me off they also wanted me to drive around my daughter in a unsafe car.\",\"Well, My experience for courtesy Chevrolet was absolutely terrible,i ended up leaving red faced and scared for my safety.As any normal client(21 years old) would do I showed up this morning looking to trade in two different dodge rams one of witch had a fried engine.I met with a sales person as soon as i stepped out which was what I expected and we did the normal walk through to find the truck i wanted.After I found a very nice 2011 silverado 4x4 and said lets go inside to start working on the appraisals of the red and black ram,and the final price of the silverado.I mentioned as well to just give me the absolute lowest price that you can do right off the bat,i don't like messing around and haggling at all.So the salesperson asked what type of number was i thinking.\",\"I wrote down 7,000 for the 06 with the fried engine and the 10,000 for the 05 ram,to my surprise they came out with an offer written on a sheet of paper which was 17,00 for the trade ins and 32,944 for the truck.It was close to my number, but i asked if he could get any closer.At this time i handed the price sheet with the offer on it back to him and said how much closer can you get to 30,000.He said wait a couple more minutes,and ordered me to go sit down i`m used to being treated like crap at car dealerships because i am young but this was just over the line.After i was withing for a couple minutes he approached my with a piece of paper that said 15,998 06 ram for 7,000 05 ram for 10,000 with a x for me to sign.The salesmen then went on to make a copy of this paper.The manager was the one filling out the price sheets and this white paper with a couple things on it.I asked if i could have the full price sheet that has the amount id be paying and the amount i will get for the trade ins.I needed this to go and take to my mom and step dad so they could look it over as well.The manager assumed i would be taking the sheet around and using it as a bargaining power at other dealers.He said that no he will not give it to me but i can have the other non-formal sheet.I said if i cant have the regular price sheet then im going to have to go somewhere else.He would not give it to me so i proceeded to walk out the door with the other sheet he gave me.I was a couple steps from my car when the salesperson i was working with tried to snatch it out of my hand,then asked me if he could have it,he had a copy in his hand so i said no and proceeded to open the door and get in my truck.He then started raising his voice demanding me to give it to him.I wanted to bring it home to my mom so i said no.\",\"At this point the salesperson punched my car door slamming it on my hand a leg witch were still in the door jam.At this time i opened the door back up because my hand and foot were caught and proceeded to step outside,at this time another van Chevrolet employee wearing a tan collared shirt and jeans came up behind me grabbed my by the shirt and arms and tried to shove me out of the way to get that little meaningless piece of paper.I would not let him inside my truck, at this point i was shaking i was so scared.\",\"His fellow salespeople the  restrained him as well.At this time i went back into the office to speak to the manager i was dealing with.HE looked surprised by the situation.And asked if anybody saw,every salesperson turned an walked away.I was absolutely hysterical because i was just assaulted by two staff members from courtesy Chevrolet i didn't know what to do call the police or just leave because i could have been assaulted even more.I did use some swear words(witch i should have not done)after i was assaulted.I was just dumbfounded that car salesmen from this supposedly respected dealership would actually put their hands on a customer at all!!\",\"!I don't know if it was because i am so young and they thought they could just try and shove me to the ground and get away with it,all over a piece of paper that had three numbers written on it.I know that there were video cameras set up that i could see right above me .It should have been able to catch everything that happened.I tried to give as detailed of an account of the incident that i could.I have also been trying to get in touch with the owner of courtesy Chevrolet as well with no luck.I am basically just getting blown off.I would not recommend this dealer to anyone unless you feel like getting assaulted by some of their staff members.I felt like they were all about to gang up on me and continue to try and force their way into my truck.I have never had anything like this happen before in my life.Myself,My family and my friends will never be going back to courtesy Chevrolet anytime in the future.I still cant believe i was assaulted by two sales staff when i was about to spend 16,000 dollars at their business.Avoid courtesy Chevrolet at all costs.\",\"Looked at 2010 Z-71 on Friday night, said I will be back to purchase.\",\"Came back the next day, there was now a scratch on the tailgate from backing into a sign, stated they would take care of it and that it wouldn't take too long.\",\"Called back that week

loaner, later that night went to pick up truck.\",\"Tailgate looked acceptable, clean paint job.\",\"Drove home on the freeway and noticed this horrible wind sound, even pulled off the freeway and made sure passenger side doors were closed, still bad sound.\",\"Got home and found that the drive side door was not aligned!\",\"No marks on the door, but it was not like that when I picked it up.\",\"In addition, they over-sprayed a white looking paint onto my truck.\",\"Luckily you cannot tell except for the windows which now have a film on them.\",\"I am just gonna scrape off myself, I don't want them screwing anything else up.\",\"Went straight back the next day, my 5th trip across Phoenix and met with an Asst Manager.\",\"He said to come back on Monday and they would give me another loaner and fix the door.\",\"Go back Monday, 6th trip, the on duty manager tells me there is no car to loan and I have to explain again to another employee what is going on with the

dealership.\",\"As far a their service department goes, they could be more honest with wait times.\",\"And why make an appointment for an oil change if it is going to take just as long as if I drove up on my own?\",\"Basically they tried to sell me a 9,000 dollar car for 20,000 dollars.\",\"If you have time feel free to read my detailed review below:\\n\\nNot sure how this place has such good reviews.\",\"The sales person I was dealing with seemed nice, however my experience went downhill after I had chose a car.\",\"They gave me a list of monthly payments that I could choose from, not the total out the door price of the car.\",\"The lowest monthly payment for the 9,000 dollar car I was going to buy was over $350 a month.\",\"I calculated the total price over the life of the loan and realized they were trying to sell me a 9,000 dollar car for almost 20,000 dollars.\",\"I told them that was way too high and that I wanted to see the total price including tax, title, and registration

to get me to take but still way more than the car was worth.\",\"They didn't want to remove their extra add-ons that I didn't want which totaled over $2,500 (extra warranty, free nitrogen for life,

deal with a couple of other dealers, that I appreciated his interest but I will move forward with the one of the others (I do not like the 20 times back and forward to get the &quot;best deal&quot;), It seems that he did not like it and just told me that it was impossible and that they just were telling me what I want to hear, we were not in the same page and was good to find out so early in the process so we do not waste each other time........\",\"I am completely agree, will look for the ones that are pushing to get my business.\",\"..... Jason Church contacted me later, totally different approach, but at the end overall experience wasn't any good, I changed some rate numbers, I do not have a doubt that they are the number one dealership, sometimes you loose ground and have to come back to the basics.\",\"I bought a Grand Caravan on saturday 10/20/12 that day the attention was wonderful, when we were driving our Van back to our house, the Van started checking when we hit the brakes that experience was very scary, we inmediatelly contact our sales person Brooke Slader and she helped us, we came back on Monday after work and Lucio Gomez received us with a very rude attitude and told us that we have to drive the Van like that and come back on Wednesday, he doesn't care about the risk that he put my family under; this is not ACCEPTABLE, I'm paying for 2011 pretty much new car just 1 year old, and just because he doesn't want to received the car and give me another car meanwhile they fix the Van, like correspond to the dealer.\",\"The managers are suppose to resolve customers needs and they are the last step when escalate action is needed, I really don't know what idiot make this guy a manager he doesn't know

ABOUT MY FAMILY.\",\"We went in to ask some questions and to find out how much we would get for trading our vehicles.\",\"We were interested in a traverse because we have a growing family and simply wanted to know what we needed to do to make that goal.\",\"They convinced us that it was possible to make a deal now and after much negotiating we ended up trading in our Cruze and leasing a new 2012 Traverse.\",\"We signed the contract and were off in our new family vehicle.\",\"This was Sunday and everything was great until a couple days later when we received a call from the dealer saying that the deal was not approved and they needed the traverse back.\",\"Really?\",\"This was after we had already signed the contract.\",\"My feelings wouldn't have been hurt if they had simply told me that we do not qualify at this time and let us know what we needed to do in order to qualify.\",\"After all, we were there for that purpose anyway.\",\"Instead, I was left insulted and embarrassed.\",\"That\\u2019s ok because instead of earning my gratitude and future business, I will instead be sharing this review where ever I can to warn folks about the practices of this dealership.\",\"Is this really how Chevrolet does business now?\",\"set up service to be done at least three time to make sure all was a go and noone could get anthing right????\",\"I waited over two hours for a first oil service???\",\"I was asked if I wanted my tires rotated after the truck was off the lift???\",\"And then when my truck finally was supposed to be ready to go I still had to ask for the truck to be washed when I was sure that I made it clear that I would like it to be washed from the get go?\",\"If no shuttle service on Saturdays why not let the customer know before he showes up expecting this severice.\",\"I had two employees tell me not to worry about it, that I could bet a shuttle to my daughter in laws to wait for my truck???\",\"Please retrain all employees in customer service...I know this dealers has done better in the past.\",\"Initial sells was great.\",\"However there were alot of complication after the sell was made.\",\"Very difficult to get a hold of someone who could help infact I still have not been able to.\",\"I went to courtesy Chevrolet because of the reputation I had heard from others.\",\"even though it was more the 35 miles from my home.\",\"I ended up finding the perfect car for me, my salesmen Brandon was great, he didn't pressure me at all.\",\"I even thought the price was fair.\",\"they offered me a deal of $328 a month at 60 months.\",\"with only $150 down.\",\"When I went back to sign papers that deal had magically changed to $398 at 72 months with $150 down.\",\"I still agreed, because there was an extended warranty included.\",\"So happily left with my new car.\",\"A few days later I get a call, saying I needed to come back and finalize the deal, I told the person I thought it was.\",\"he said no it wasn't and to please come down.\",\"So I did... \\n\\nwhen I got there I was told it would be an additional $350 down for the car.\",\"I asked what happened to the other deal... and I got some run around answer.\",\"At this point almost a week later I had put some money into the car, so I reluctantly agreed.\",\"two days after that I woke up to a flat tire.\",\"so I went to get it replaced.\",\"the tire company pointed out that the tires were made in early 2006 and were completely dry routed.\",\"so 4 new tires were need.\",\"I tried calling the dealership 4 time and left messages all for time.\",\"but did not receive a response until the next day.\",\"when I explained the sales manager said he would look into the issue, I waited a day and got no call back.\",\"so I again called and left several messages and almost another week later I still have no resolution to this issue.\",\"Questions to the dealership... why would you leave tires on a car that were older then the car its self and pass them off as safe?\",\"why does your sales manager say one thing and you end up with something completely different?\",\"why is it so hard to pick a phone and call someone back?    \\n

left the dealership highly disappointed and angry.\",\"I was told I would get a lower APR, lower car payment and a brand new vehicle.\",\"All of that was information was wrong.\",\"Upon my arrival, I was shuffled around between employees until I met Kiros.\",\"Kiros represented himself to be professional, but there was a huge language barrier.\",\"He has a very thick accent, so it was very hard to understand Kiros at times.\",\"Kiros took me to the new cars and showed me all the fancy vehicles, but whenever I inquired about the cost (some of them didn't have the final price on the windshield) he would tell me, \\\"Don't worry about the price.\",\"We'll deal with that later.\\\"\",\"Not ok with me!\",\"Kiros never once inquired about what I wanted in a vehicle or what I would like my monthly payments to be.\",\"After test driving a new vehicle he had me pull back to the dealership so he could \\\"crunch numbers.\\\"\",\"He came back in and started to fluff up all the new car features and kept skirting around what my monthly car payment would be.\",\"After realizing the new car would put me in a higher APR and a higher car payment I grew upset.\",\"When Kiros could tell that I wasn't happy with the information I was receiving he proceeded to remind me of my credit score and insinuated that since it wasn't a top notch score I wasn't going to receive the APR or payments I was looking for.\",\"Kiros tried to get me to commit to bringing in more money on the car and almost refused to take no for an answer.\",\"I'm sorry, but when I'm told from an employee that \\\"no money down, we'll pay off your existing loan with a lower APR and lower car payment\\\" then I expect just that.\",\"Kiros then asked me about my current loan and the current APR (for the 10th time might I add.\",\"It's always fun when you have to continually repeat yourself) on my car, when I informed him of my low APR he looked at me and said, \\\"are you sure about that?\",\"that's a great APR and they normally don't give that low of an APR especially to someone with your credit score.\",\"are you sure that's right?\\\"\",\"To insult my intelligence and to make comments about my credit score (it's a pretty good score, might i add) is totally unprofessional and that was the final straw for me.\",\"After spending two hours at the dealership and tired of not being heard, I was ready to go.\",\"I asked Kiros for the keys to my car three times and on the final demand he gave them back to me.\",\"I think the first time a customer asks for their car keys back you should give them to them and not play this game of \\\"yes ma'am, but please give me two more minutes to see if I can get you a better deal.\\\"\",\"I'm an educated woman, so I don't like it when I made to feel like I'm an idiot.\",\"Kiros did just that and then some!\",\"I felt like he thought because I was a woman that I could be easily lured into a contract that would only put a giant financial burden on me.\",\"The repeating of information over and over again to him was exhausting.\",\"Write it down if you know your memory isn't the greatest and don't insult someone's intelligence or credit score just because you may feel the person is wrong.\",\"My first experience at Courtesy with Steve Rimer was amazing.\",\"Steve listened to what I wanted in a vehicle and what I was looking for in a car payment.\",\"He never made me feel like I was stupid or uneducated and he let me do the wheeling and dealing.\",\"I walked away in 2011 with a brand new car, awesome APR and decent car payment.\",\"Now that's how deals are done!\",\"There is a quote that I like to live my life by and I use it in my daily dealings with people, because I too work in the customer service field, \\\"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\\\"\",\"Driving off that lot I felt mislead, stupid and I was angry at myself for allowing someone to talk down to me.\",\"I'm honestly not sure if I ever want to do business with Courtesy ever again because of this bad experience, let alone recommend Kiros to anyone.\",\"Unfortunately for Courtesy I am a very loyal person and had every intention of continuing business with them, but once I feel like I am being deceived it is very hard for me to get that trust back.   \",\"This place is full of scam artists and liars.\",\"They do not stand by their word and will do anything to get you in a car and then you are treated disgracefully.\",\"Update: I did

while waiting for an oil change.\",\"I asked when I arrived how long it was going to take and was advised approximately an hour and half.\",\"After about an hour I decided to step outside, where I happened to be able to view my vehicle on the lift with no one working on it.\",\"I waited outside for 45 minutes and no one touched my vehicle.\",\"I then searched out my service advisor and asked when it would be done.\",\"He looked and said it was completed.\",\"So basically they made me wait 45 minutes for no reason.\",\"I find it very rude of the service department to not value the customer's time.\",\"The second experience was also for an oil change.\",\"When they pulled my car up, I instantly noticed that my rear bumper was pulled off slightly and scrapes on the rear quarter panel.\",\"They did take it in for repairs and provide a rental car, but it was very upsetting that they would damage the vehicle and attempt to return it without advising me about it and hoping that I would not notice. \",\"was the worst experience I've ever had, they called me with an offer and it was a lie, I wasted my time with them\",\"Sat there for an hour and a half and got no help the

going to make that call.\",\"He then leaves.\",\"So now the lab coat guy comes back and asked me if I had been helped yet.\",\"I explained what was going on and he said that he would get on this right

how physics work?!?!\",\"Anyways, he tells me he's not going to do anything.\",\"Steven Pastrana at this point is now swearing that he warned me about any cracks etc.\",\"before I signed anything - he didn't do that by the way.\",\"So they hand me my paperwork back and say, You're on your own, that's not our problem.\",\"So I walked back inside, handed the Salesman that went on the test drive with me his business card back and let him know of everything that happened.\",\"His jaw dropped as I walked away....I'm assuming at this point because he lost out on a 2013 4x4 sale, not because he wanted

never change the info online.\",\"I told them that was crap and dishonest and clearly bait and switch.\",\"Then, I get told by a mgr that called me that the ONE person in the company that knows how to change this info online is out of the country and the info can't be changed until he returns.\",\"Hmmm.\",\"how did the new pics get there???\",\"And shortly after my few ranting phone calls about bait and switch, suddenly the ONE guy must have come back into the country because the price was fixed online.\",\"it was one lie after another.\",\"Then, we return 2 weeks later to buy the other car that we had looked at and as we're having them do the paperwork, we realize they've taken stuff off of the Jeep.\",\"We asked where the side rails were for the vehicle because we thought we were buying the vehicle intact and as we first drove it.\",\"No one had any clue.\",\"We asked what else had been taken off.\",\"We were told nothing.\",\"So, I wanted the side rails back and I put up a fit about it to everyone.\",\"I got different stories from every person or manager that I spoke with.\",\"From we don't know, to someone in the back may have taken them, they may have been put on another vehicle, the best......this isn't the same Jeep that we looked at (umm, yes it is, it has very distinct marking and decals) and the last excuse was that they were taken off because they were rusty and a liability.\",\"NO they were not.\",\"and if that was the case, why wouldn't you replace with good ones.\",\"so, again, I asked multiple times, what else did you guys take off the vehicle that I cant see?\",\"Each time, I was told nothing.\",\"So, I got over the side rails issue because it really wasn't a deal breaker.\",\"we continue with the paperwork, buy the car and as we're driving away, we find out they removed the subwoofer and speaker that was in the Jeep.\",\"Again, not what we knew we were buying.\",\"The radio sounded like a transistor radio.\",\"At this point, I raised xxxx.\",\"I was fed up with constant lies.\",\"I'm not stupid and they treat you as if you are.\",\"I know what I test drove and I know what was there.\",\"And all of this information was coming from Management.\",\"That's how good their management team is!\",\"All BS'ers\\nThey did fix the speaker issue and replace with new ones but, not w/o a hassle and a lot of aggravation, no apology and I had no vehicle for a day and 1/2 while they fixed issues they caused themselves.\",\"They've either got thievery going on in their dealership or they knowingly are removing equipment off of vehicles after both listing the equipment in the cars and customers test driving them.\",\"Very shady!\",\"So, then, to put the icing on the cake at this point.\",\"The car on the inside was filthy.\",\"I asked that before I pick it up, they clean it.\",\"Who sells a dirty car?\",\"who delivers a dirty car to a customer that has just purchased it?\",\"They delivered a filthy car to me.\",\"It wasn't cleaned inside at all.\",\"it was wiped down.\",\"it has mud splatter inside on the seats and caked dirt all over the seat brackets on the floor, the pedal, the entire car was filthy and disgusting.\",\"I understand that it's an suv and the previous owner obviously used it to go rock climbing quite a bit but, I've never seen a dealership that doesn't detail their cars before they sell them.\",\"or I don't know......clean them!\",\"There's More!\",\"So, I purchased this Jeep in late July, then in October, the airbag light came on.\",\"I called Courtesy because they told me that the Jeep was certified (and I have it in pictures) and that there was a 3k/3mos warranty.\",\"What was I told on the phone when called?\",\"no, no warranty on the car sorry.......BUT, when we sold you the car we also sold you an extended warranty, just use that.\",\"I was once again livid.\",\"But, arguing gets you no where, they just don't want to hear it.\",\"That's great that they sold me an extended warranty with a $200 deductible but, they should be honoring what they told me and less than 3mos after purchase, your not standing behind what you sold??\",\"REALLY?!\",\"They did however tell me that I was more than welcome to bring my Jeep in and use my extended warranty with them.\",\"I told them I would go anywhere but to them and I wouldn't give them a cent.\",\"So, I went to Bill Luke Jeep.\",\"Paid $100 for diagnostic testing.\",\"They told me that there were several recalls on the Jeep, Courtesy didn't even bother to take care of these recalls before selling, one being the airbag (which by the way, Courtesy also told me that the airbag issue would come out of my pocket because the ex warranty wouldn't cover that).\",\"Bill Luke continued to look into the Jeep and found that the ENTIRE front end needed to be replaced.\",\"They were appalled that another dealership would even sell a vehicle in this condition.\",\"So, $3000.00 later, minus my $200 deductible and $100 for diagnostic testing, my Jeep has a new front end.\",\"Thank God for Bill Luke!!\",\"(that will be a whole other review)  Bill Luke took care of what Courtesy wouldn't!\",\"The fact that Courtesy sold this vehicle in the condition it was in, is unforgivable and the fact that they don't even stand behind their stuff, even worse.\",\"AND they don't take care of recalls on cars before selling them.\",\"OH and theres even more.\",\"The front end work was in October, less than 3 mos after purchase.\",\"I happened to glance at my license plate about a week ago and noticed that it said November 2015.\",\"They gave me 3 month tags.\",\"WHO DOES THAT?!\",\"they didn't tell me they were doing that.\",\"I didn't think of asking or even checking.\",\"You pay 30k for a vehicle, you would think they would have put $250 in there for tags.\",\"I've bought numerous vehicles through the years, I've never had to deal with tags, straight out of a sale.\",\"They always write that into the contract.\",\"But, Courtesy didn't.\",\"Nope!\",\"and I didn't even get anything in the mail saying they were due (I'm sure it's too soon after the purchase to catch up with me) so, 4 mos after purchase and right before Christmas, I have to fork out another $250.00 for tags and a late fee.\",\"What is wrong with them?!\",\"I've tried calling Courtesy to complain and give them an earful but, they don't want to hear it.\",\"They claim no responsibility.\",\"They got their money, that is all they care about.\",\"Clearly since they sell vehicles that are unfit to be sold and charge top dollar for them.\",\"I'll never return to Courtesy.\",\"They gave me free oil changes with my purchase HA!\",\"they can keep them because they will never work on my Jeep or get another cent from me.\",\"In fact they should be giving me back my $300 I had to pay for deductible and diagnostic testing and my $250 for tags.\",\"But, since they don't want to even return phone calls, they will pretend like none of this happened and we'll just go away so they can sucker someone else.\",\"Stay Away from this dealership!!!\",\"Even the sub-par cash and carry dealerships on the corners around town give 3000mi/3mos but, Courtesy doesn't???\",\"Really?\",\"!  \\n\",\"I bought a CERTIFIED 2013 Chevy Silverado with 13000 miles from Courtesy Chevrolet.\",\"It had a chirping noise from the engine within 1 week of owning the car.\",\"I brought it to the closest chevy dealership which was Autonation Gilbert Chevrolet.\",\"They said it was due to overspray from detail dressing from Courtesy.\",\"Courtesy said it was not a warranty item and would not pay for a simple 10 minute belt replacement for $100.\",\"I talked to both the \\\"used car manager\\\" and customer service and both said too bad.\",\"Customer service is not a part of Courtesy Chevrolet.\",\"The buy one, get one for Black Friday seems to be a lie.\",\"They tell you that what they have to give for free is just a bunch of junkers that are not worth more than $2000 and try to convince you that you will not get a good deal if you take them.\",\"I spent many hours there and didn't see anyone leaving with one of those cars or the gifts they had on the raffle.\",\"Besides that the manager was VERY RUDE and treated us like if we were asking him to give us something when we were going to buy.\",\"Even told us that their internet prices are not real, they are just to attract people.\",\"We had problems with the keys and had to drive back to fix it because they wanted to charge for us to have the original key and remote.\",\"We ended up buying and traded in our car and after almost 2 weeks, they haven't paid it to the bank.\",\"There are many dealers around it, so don't ever go there.\",\"I live 98 miles from this dealer ship.I found a Silverado 1500 on the Internet that I was interested in.I Talked to Anthony about the truck and told him this is what I'm looking for and that I would like to take the truck for a test drive.\",\"I called him in the morning before I left home and he told me the truck was detailed and ready to be test driven.when I showed up at the dealership the truck was not cleaned and was up on a service rack being worked on .I wasted 5 hours of driving time because of Anthony.The dealership has not done anything to make this rite.\",\"Mark Johnson\",\"My wife and I purchased a 2014 Ford Escape from Courtesy about a month ago.\",\"They had a great price listed for it so we went to check it out.\",\"Our sales person was polite and helpful.\",\"The Escape has some minor cosmetic issues and a slight smell (previous owner must have had a dog) in the interior, but for the price we were able to look past it at the time.\",\"I barely noticed the smell to be honest, but we did have the windows open.\",\"We came to an agreement on price and they did a good basic cleaning of the interior for us before we took it home.\",\"After having it in the garage for 1 night with the windows closed I noticed that the \\\"pet\\\" smell was really bad.\",\"It is a urine and dander odor, which drive my allergies nuts.\",\"I took it to my local car detailer and had them shampoo the carpets and upholstery.\",\"It got better but the vents still needed cleaning.\",\"I checked the cabin air filter and it looked new.\",\"So I got some Ozone spray and used that to try to clean out the vents.\",\"Still unable to drive with the windows up after all of this.\",\"So I have had the car for a week at this point and had spent $150 on cleaning.\",\"I contacted Courtesy and advised them of the smell problem, as well as the USB ports in the center console were not working.\",\"The CSI Manager Debbie contacted me promptly and scheduled a loaner car so I could get to work and said they would fog the interior and look into the usb ports.\",\"When I went to pick up my Escape the next day at 7am they could not find my vehicle or the paperwork for it.\",\"They had to contact Debbie and she had my keys in her desk.\",\"Nobody there was able to tell me what was done, if anything.\",\"Before leaving I tested the USB ports, which were still not working.\",\"I asked the nice lady that was assisting me to tell Debbie to call me when she got in that morning.\",\"I never received a call.\",\"And the smell was again better but after using the heater for a few minutes it still smelled.\",\"Needless to say I was not happy.\",\"This was the Tuesday before Christmas so I didn't have the time to get it back to them that week.\",\"Usually getting a new vehicle is something to be proud of, to show off to friends and family.\",\"But the smell made me reluctant to do so.\",\"After Christmas and New Years I contacted Debbie again via email explaining that there was still a bad odor and the usb ports still were not working.\",\"I asked her what was done during the day I left my Escape with them.\",\"She replied saying they did a \\\"bio-sweep\\\" for 8hrs.... she said nothing about them looking into the USB ports.\",\"She said \\\"As far as the USB ports he will be glad to take a look at those if you want to bring it in Monday \\u2013 Thursday\\\"  Which led me to believe that they didn't even look into the USB before.\",\"I again emailed her back explaining that the \\\"bio-sweep\\\" didn't do anything from what I could tell and asked why the USB ports  were not looked into the last time.\",\"I never received a call or email back from her..... that was a week ago!\",\"I like the vehicle and I will have to get a detailer to try to get rid of the pet odor on my own.\",\"That being said the customer service at Courtesy Chevrolet is sub-par and if they are going to sell used vehicles they should make sure that they meet some basic standards

was going to get the truck just to stop by made an appointment twice first time didn't make it 30 minutes late they close at 9, cool just drove 6 hours but okay I'll drive back had work next day they couldn't wait for a sale I guess, set another appointment that weekend presidential sale truck dropped to (39k+) arrived seen the truck I wanted was upfront used car building maybe thought they preped it cause that's the truck I came to see from California, noticed it was dirty and looked like someone was driving it around and it was locked asked to have my appointment with Daryl to find out he was busy with another customer someone else Ernaan/Eddie Hernandez pretty sure it was Ernaan picture looks like Eddie could be same guy but anyways he helped us out instead told him that was the truck I wanted and he said it can't be the manager has been driving that truck around he has the keys LITERALLY in his pocket you can get the keys to any truck but that one, I responded I came specifically from Cali for that truck he said he would have to check everything again to see if I was good, I told him Daryl had already done all that, he said nothing was done agreed again to check my credit, came back and said it was okay but I couldn't get the truck said I needed 5k down i agreed to it, left came back said I needed a cosigner again i agreed gave him a cosigner, left came back said didnt help I need a cosigner with high 700 credit excuse after excuse kept going and at the end asked for 10k down and still I don't think you'll be able to get the truck when asked well how much is the truck he responded well I don't know let me check...well how is it I'm not getting approved when you don't even know how much the truck is?\",\"Looked it up said it was 39k funny enough I had already

fine with the guy on the phone telling me that they would not be able to offer me that much for my trade but they fact that I had to use my gas and put 60 more miles on my lower millage car only for

walking out they offered me  500 off and I accepted it.\",\"It was still 1500 more than I should have paid with the buy one get one deal, but it was still a good deal.\",\"Then it was time to meet with the financing guy and he was awesome!\",\"He was the lone bright spot to my experience.\",\"So then comes the next day and I was told to call and set up an time to get my car detailed.\",\"So I call and after being transferred three times I get a lady's voicemail so I leave a message and I waited a couple hours and since I received no response I tried again and got transferred 3 times again
