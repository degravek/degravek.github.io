  bio: My name is Kyle DeGrave, and I'm a postdoctoral research scientist working for NorthWest Research Associates in Boulder, Colorado. I received my PhD in astronomy (emphasis in solar physics) from New Mexico State University in May of 2015. My current research focuses on studying plasma flows in the solar interior associated with features like sunspots and supergranulation, using a technique called helioseismology. Links to a few of my papers regarding these topics are shown below.  My goal with this site is to showcase some of the small data science projects that I've been working on in an attempt to get my feet wet in the broad and exciting field of data science. I am very excited by the possibility of being part of a team that provides data-driven solutions to problems that matter to both business as well as consumers. The work of a data scientist has the ability to impact people in their everyday lives in a way that is not necessarily possible with my current research. This, coupled with the fact that data science is such an extensive subject, incorporating the principles of many scientific disciplines like mathematics, computer science, and machine learning is very appealing to me. I hope that this portfolio will convey some of the skills I've acquired in Python data visualization and analysis. Thanks for visiting!
